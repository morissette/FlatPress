It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.\n\n```js\nvar request = require(\'request\');\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function (error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    console.log(body) // Show the HTML for the Google homepage.\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Streaming](#streaming)\n- [Forms](#forms)\n- [HTTP Authentication](#http-authentication)\n- [Custom HTTP Headers](#custom-http-headers)\n- [OAuth Signing](#oauth-signing)\n- [Proxies](#proxies)\n- [Unix Domain Sockets](#unix-domain-sockets)\n- [TLS/SSL Protocol](#tlsssl-protocol)\n- [Support for HAR 1.2](#support-for-har-12)\n- [**All Available Options**](#requestoptions-callback)\n\nRequest also offers [convenience methods](#convenience-methods) like\n`request.defaults` and `request.post`, and there are\nlots of [usage examples](#examples) and several\n[debugging techniques](#debugging).\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Streaming\n\nYou can stream any response to a file stream.\n\n```js\nrequest(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nYou can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types (in this case `application/json`) and use the proper `content-type` in the PUT request (if the headers don’t already provide one).\n\n```js\nfs.createReadStream(\'file.json\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/obj.json\'))\n```\n\nRequest can also `pipe` to itself. When doing so, `content-type` and `content-length` are preserved in the PUT headers.\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://google.com/img.png\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nRequest emits a "response" event when a response is received. The `response` argument will be an instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage).\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .get(\'http://google.com/img.png\')\n  .on(\'response\', function(response) {\n    console.log(response.statusCode) // 200\n    console.log(response.headers[\'content-type\']) // \'image/png\'\n  })\n  .pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nTo easily handle errors when streaming requests, listen to the `error` event before piping:\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n  .on(\'error\', function(err) {\n    console.log(err)\n  })\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nNow let’s get fancy.\n\n```js\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    if (req.method === \'PUT\') {\n      req.pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\'))\n    } else if (req.method === \'GET\' || req.method === \'HEAD\') {\n      request.get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can also `pipe()` from `http.ServerRequest` instances, as well as to `http.ServerResponse` instances. The HTTP method, headers, and entity-body data will be sent. Which means that, if you don\'t really care about security, you can do:\n\n```js\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    var x = request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n    req.pipe(x)\n    x.pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAnd since `pipe()` returns the destination stream in ≥ Node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying. :)\n\n```js\nreq.pipe(request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')).pipe(resp)\n```\n\nAlso, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.\n\n```js\nvar r = request.defaults({\'proxy\':\'http://localproxy.com\'})\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    r.get(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Forms\n\n`request` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads. For `multipart/related` refer to the `multipart` API.\n\n\n#### application/x-www-form-urlencoded (URL-Encoded Forms)\n\nURL-encoded forms are simple.\n\n```js\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', {form:{key:\'value\'}})\n// or\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\').form({key:\'value\'})\n// or\nrequest.post({url:\'http://service.com/upload\', form: {key:\'value\'}}, function(err,httpResponse,body){ /* ... */ })\n```\n\n\n#### multipart/form-data (Multipart Form Uploads)\n\nFor `multipart/form-data` we use the [form-data](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) library by [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge). For the most cases, you can pass your upload form data via the `formData` option.\n\n\n```js\nvar formData = {\n  // Pass a simple key-value pair\n  my_field: \'my_value\',\n  // Pass data via Buffers\n  my_buffer: new Buffer([1, 2, 3]),\n  // Pass data via Streams\n  my_file: fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/unicycle.jpg\'),\n  // Pass multiple values /w an Array\n  attachments: [\n    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/attachment1.jpg\'),\n    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/attachment2.jpg\')\n  ],\n  // Pass optional meta-data with an \'options\' object with style: {value: DATA, options: OPTIONS}\n  // Use case: for some types of streams, you\'ll need to provide "file"-related information manually.\n  // See the `form-data` README for more information about options: https://github.com/form-data/form-data\n  custom_file: {\n    value:  fs.createReadStream(\'/dev/urandom\'),\n    options: {\n      filename: \'topsecret.jpg\',\n      contentType: \'image/jpg\'\n    }\n  }\n};\nrequest.post({url:\'http://service.com/upload\', formData: formData}, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.error(\'upload failed:\', err);\n  }\n  console.log(\'Upload successful!  Server responded with:\', body);\n});\n```\n\nFor advanced cases, you can access the form-data object itself via `r.form()`. This can be modified until the request is fired on the next cycle of the event-loop. (Note that this calling `form()` will clear the currently set form data for that request.)\n\n```js\n// NOTE: Advanced use-case, for normal use see \'formData\' usage above\nvar r = request.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {...})\nvar form = r.form();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my_value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer([1, 2, 3]));\nform.append(\'custom_file\', fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/unicycle.jpg\'), {filename: \'unicycle.jpg\'});\n```\nSee the [form-data README](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) for more information & examples.\n\n\n#### multipart/related\n\nSome variations in different HTTP implementations require a newline/CRLF before, after, or both before and after the boundary of a `multipart/related` request (using the multipart option). This has been observed in the .NET WebAPI version 4.0. You can turn on a boundary preambleCRLF or postamble by passing them as `true` to your request options.\n\n```js\n  request({\n    method: \'PUT\',\n    preambleCRLF: true,\n    postambleCRLF: true,\n    uri: \'http://service.com/upload\',\n    multipart: [\n      {\n        \'content-type\': \'application/json\',\n        body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n      },\n      { body: \'I am an attachment\' },\n      { body: fs.createReadStream(\'image.png\') }\n    ],\n    // alternatively pass an object containing additional options\n    multipart: {\n      chunked: false,\n      data: [\n        {\n          \'content-type\': \'application/json\',\n          body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        },\n        { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  function (error, response, body) {\n    if (error) {\n      return console.error(\'upload failed:\', error);\n    }\n    console.log(\'Upload successful!  Server responded with:\', body);\n  })\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## HTTP Authentication\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\').auth(\'username\', \'password\', false);\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'user\': \'username\',\n    \'pass\': \'password\',\n    \'sendImmediately\': false\n  }\n});\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\').auth(null, null, true, \'bearerToken\');\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'bearer\': \'bearerToken\'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf passed as an option, `auth` should be a hash containing values:\n\n- `user` || `username`\n- `pass` || `password`\n- `sendImmediately` (optional)\n- `bearer` (optional)\n\nThe method form takes parameters\n`auth(username, password, sendImmediately, bearer)`.\n\n`sendImmediately` defaults to `true`, which causes a basic or bearer\nauthentication header to be sent.  If `sendImmediately` is `false`, then\n`request` will retry with a proper authentication header after receiving a\n`401` response from the server (which must contain a `WWW-Authenticate` header\nindicating the required authentication method).\n\nNote that you can also specify basic authentication using the URL itself, as\ndetailed in [RFC 1738](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt).  Simply pass the\n`user:password` before the host with an `@` sign:\n\n```js\nvar username = \'username\',\n    password = \'password\',\n    url = \'http://\' + username + \':\' + password + \'@some.server.com\';\n\nrequest({url: url}, function (error, response, body) {\n   // Do more stuff with \'body\' here\n});\n```\n\nDigest authentication is supported, but it only works with `sendImmediately`\nset to `false`; otherwise `request` will send basic authentication on the\ninitial request, which will probably cause the request to fail.\n\nBearer authentication is supported, and is activated when the `bearer` value is\navailable. The value may be either a `String` or a `Function` returning a\n`String`. Using a function to supply the bearer token is particularly useful if\nused in conjunction with `defaults` to allow a single function to supply the\nlast known token at the time of sending a request, or to compute one on the fly.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Custom HTTP Headers\n\nHTTP Headers, such as `User-Agent`, can be set in the `options` object.\nIn the example below, we call the github API to find out the number\nof stars and forks for the request repository. This requires a\ncustom `User-Agent` header as well as https.\n\n```js\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n  url: \'https://api.github.com/repos/request/request\',\n  headers: {\n    \'User-Agent\': \'request\'\n  }\n};\n\nfunction callback(error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    var info = JSON.parse(body);\n    console.log(info.stargazers_count + " Stars");\n    console.log(info.forks_count + " Forks");\n  }\n}\n\nrequest(options, callback);\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## OAuth Signing\n\n[OAuth version 1.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849) is supported.  The\ndefault signing algorithm is\n[HMAC-SHA1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.2):\n\n```js\n// OAuth1.0 - 3-legged server side flow (Twitter example)\n// step 1\nvar qs = require(\'querystring\')\n  , oauth =\n    { callback: \'http://mysite.com/callback/\'\n    , consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n    , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n    }\n  , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token\'\n  ;\nrequest.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n  // Ideally, you would take the body in the response\n  // and construct a URL that a user clicks on (like a sign in button).\n  // The verifier is only available in the response after a user has\n  // verified with twitter that they are authorizing your app.\n\n  // step 2\n  var req_data = qs.parse(body)\n  var uri = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate\'\n    + \'?\' + qs.stringify({oauth_token: req_data.oauth_token})\n  // redirect the user to the authorize uri\n\n  // step 3\n  // after the user is redirected back to your server\n  var auth_data = qs.parse(body)\n    , oauth =\n      { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n      , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n      , token: auth_data.oauth_token\n      , token_secret: req_data.oauth_token_secret\n      , verifier: auth_data.oauth_verifier\n      }\n    , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token\'\n    ;\n  request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n    // ready to make signed requests on behalf of the user\n    var perm_data = qs.parse(body)\n      , oauth =\n        { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n        , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n        , token: perm_data.oauth_token\n        , token_secret: perm_data.oauth_token_secret\n        }\n      , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/show.json\'\n      , qs =\n        { screen_name: perm_data.screen_name\n        , user_id: perm_data.user_id\n        }\n      ;\n    request.get({url:url, oauth:oauth, qs:qs, json:true}, function (e, r, user) {\n      console.log(user)\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\nFor [RSA-SHA1 signing](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.3), make\nthe following changes to the OAuth options object:\n* Pass `signature_method : \'RSA-SHA1\'`\n* Instead of `consumer_secret`, specify a `private_key` string in\n  [PEM format](http://how2ssl.com/articles/working_with_pem_files/)\n\nFor [PLAINTEXT signing](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#anchor22), make\nthe following changes to the OAuth options object:\n* Pass `signature_method : \'PLAINTEXT\'`\n\nTo send OAuth parameters via query params or in a post body as described in The\n[Consumer Request Parameters](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#consumer_req_param)\nsection of the oauth1 spec:\n* Pass `transport_method : \'query\'` or `transport_method : \'body\'` in the OAuth\n  options object.\n* `transport_method` defaults to `\'header\'`\n\nTo use [Request Body Hash](https://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/spec/ext/body_hash/1.0/oauth-bodyhash.html) you can either\n* Manually generate the body hash and pass it as a string `body_hash: \'...\'`\n* Automatically generate the body hash by passing `body_hash: true`\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Proxies\n\nIf you specify a `proxy` option, then the request (and any subsequent\nredirects) will be sent via a connection to the proxy server.\n\nIf your endpoint is an `https` url, and you are using a proxy, then\nrequest will send a `CONNECT` request to the proxy server *first*, and\nthen use the supplied connection to connect to the endpoint.\n\nThat is, first it will make a request like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 CONNECT endpoint-server.com:80\nHost: proxy-server.com\nUser-Agent: whatever user agent you specify\n```\n\nand then the proxy server make a TCP connection to `endpoint-server`\non port `80`, and return a response that looks like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n```\n\nAt this point, the connection is left open, and the client is\ncommunicating directly with the `endpoint-server.com` machine.\n\nSee [the wikipedia page on HTTP Tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel)\nfor more information.\n\nBy default, when proxying `http` traffic, request will simply make a\nstandard proxied `http` request.  This is done by making the `url`\nsection of the initial line of the request a fully qualified url to\nthe endpoint.\n\nFor example, it will make a single request that looks like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 GET http://endpoint-server.com/some-url\nHost: proxy-server.com\nOther-Headers: all go here\n\nrequest body or whatever\n```\n\nBecause a pure "http over http" tunnel offers no additional security\nor other features, it is generally simpler to go with a\nstraightforward HTTP proxy in this case.  However, if you would like\nto force a tunneling proxy, you may set the `tunnel` option to `true`.\n\nYou can also make a standard proxied `http` request by explicitly setting\n`tunnel : false`, but **note that this will allow the proxy to see the traffic\nto/from the destination server**.\n\nIf you are using a tunneling proxy, you may set the\n`proxyHeaderWhiteList` to share certain headers with the proxy.\n\nYou can also set the `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` to share certain\nheaders only with the proxy and not with destination host.\n\nBy default, this set is:\n\n```\naccept\naccept-charset\naccept-encoding\naccept-language\naccept-ranges\ncache-control\ncontent-encoding\ncontent-language\ncontent-length\ncontent-location\ncontent-md5\ncontent-range\ncontent-type\nconnection\ndate\nexpect\nmax-forwards\npragma\nproxy-authorization\nreferer\nte\ntransfer-encoding\nuser-agent\nvia\n```\n\nNote that, when using a tunneling proxy, the `proxy-authorization`\nheader and any headers from custom `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` are\n*never* sent to the endpoint server, but only to the proxy server.\n\n\n### Controlling proxy behaviour using environment variables\n\nThe following environment variables are respected by `request`:\n\n * `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy`\n * `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`\n * `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy`\n\nWhen `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy` are set, they will be used to proxy non-SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option present. Similarly, `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy` will be respected for SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option. It is valid to define a proxy in one of the environment variables, but then override it for a specific request, using the `proxy` configuration option. Furthermore, the `proxy` configuration option can be explicitly set to false / null to opt out of proxying altogether for that request.\n\n`request` is also aware of the `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` environment variables. These variables provide a granular way to opt out of proxying, on a per-host basis. It should contain a comma separated list of hosts to opt out of proxying. It is also possible to opt of proxying when a particular destination port is used. Finally, the variable may be set to `*` to opt out of the implicit proxy configuration of the other environment variables.\n\nHere\'s some examples of valid `no_proxy` values:\n\n * `google.com` - don\'t proxy HTTP/HTTPS requests to Google.\n * `google.com:443` - don\'t proxy HTTPS requests to Google, but *do* proxy HTTP requests to Google.\n * `google.com:443, yahoo.com:80` - don\'t proxy HTTPS requests to Google, and don\'t proxy HTTP requests to Yahoo!\n * `*` - ignore `https_proxy`/`http_proxy` environment variables altogether.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## UNIX Domain Sockets\n\n`request` supports making requests to [UNIX Domain Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket). To make one, use the following URL scheme:\n\n```js\n/* Pattern */ \'http://unix:SOCKET:PATH\'\n/* Example */ request.get(\'http://unix:/absolute/path/to/unix.socket:/request/path\')\n```\n\nNote: The `SOCKET` path is assumed to be absolute to the root of the host file system.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## TLS/SSL Protocol\n\nTLS/SSL Protocol options, such as `cert`, `key` and `passphrase`, can be\nset directly in `options` object, in the `agentOptions` property of the `options` object, or even in `https.globalAgent.options`. Keep in mind that, although `agentOptions` allows for a slightly wider range of configurations, the recommended way is via `options` object directly, as using `agentOptions` or `https.globalAgent.options` would not be applied in the same way in proxied environments (as data travels through a TLS connection instead of an http/https agent).\n\n```js\nvar fs = require(\'fs\')\n    , path = require(\'path\')\n    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.crt\')\n    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.key\')\n    , caFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/ca.cert.pem\')\n    , request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),\n    key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),\n    passphrase: \'password\',\n    ca: fs.readFileSync(caFile)\n};\n\nrequest.get(options);\n```\n\n### Using `options.agentOptions`\n\nIn the example below, we call an API requires client side SSL certificate\n(in PEM format) with passphrase protected private key (in PEM format) and disable the SSLv3 protocol:\n\n```js\nvar fs = require(\'fs\')\n    , path = require(\'path\')\n    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.crt\')\n    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.key\')\n    , request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),\n        key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),\n        // Or use `pfx` property replacing `cert` and `key` when using private key, certificate and CA certs in PFX or PKCS12 format:\n        // pfx: fs.readFileSync(pfxFilePath),\n        passphrase: \'password\',\n        securityOptions: \'SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3\'\n    }\n};\n\nrequest.get(options);\n```\n\nIt is able to force using SSLv3 only by specifying `secureProtocol`:\n\n```js\nrequest.get({\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        secureProtocol: \'SSLv3_method\'\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIt is possible to accept other certificates than those signed by generally allowed Certificate Authorities (CAs).\nThis can be useful, for example,  when using self-signed certificates.\nTo require a different root certificate, you can specify the signing CA by adding the contents of the CA\'s certificate file to the `agentOptions`.\nThe certificate the domain presents must be signed by the root certificate specified:\n\n```js\nrequest.get({\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        ca: fs.readFileSync(\'ca.cert.pem\')\n    }\n});\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Support for HAR 1.2\n\nThe `options.har` property will override the values: `url`, `method`, `qs`, `headers`, `form`, `formData`, `body`, `json`, as well as construct multipart data and read files from disk when `request.postData.params[].fileName` is present without a matching `value`.\n\na validation step will check if the HAR Request format matches the latest spec (v1.2) and will skip parsing if not matching.\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n  request({\n    // will be ignored\n    method: \'GET\',\n    uri: \'http://www.google.com\',\n\n    // HTTP Archive Request Object\n    har: {\n      url: \'http://www.mockbin.com/har\',\n      method: \'POST\',\n      headers: [\n        {\n          name: \'content-type\',\n          value: \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n        }\n      ],\n      postData: {\n        mimeType: \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\',\n        params: [\n          {\n            name: \'foo\',\n            value: \'bar\'\n          },\n          {\n            name: \'hello\',\n            value: \'world\'\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  })\n\n  // a POST request will be sent to http://www.mockbin.com\n  // with body an application/x-www-form-urlencoded body:\n  // foo=bar&hello=world\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## request(options, callback)\n\nThe first argument can be either a `url` or an `options` object. The only required option is `uri`; all others are optional.\n\n- `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from `url.parse()`\n- `baseUrl` - fully qualified uri string used as the base url. Most useful with `request.defaults`, for example when you want to do many requests to the same domain.  If `baseUrl` is `https://example.com/api/`, then requesting `/end/point?test=true` will fetch `https://example.com/api/end/point?test=true`. When `baseUrl` is given, `uri` must also be a string.\n- `method` - http method (default: `"GET"`)\n- `headers` - http headers (default: `{}`)\n\n---\n\n- `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the `uri`\n- `qsParseOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.parse](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#parsing-objects) method. Alternatively pass options to the [querystring.parse](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_parse_str_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:\';\', eq:\':\', options:{}}`\n- `qsStringifyOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.stringify](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#stringifying) method. Alternatively pass options to the  [querystring.stringify](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_stringify_obj_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:\';\', eq:\':\', options:{}}`. For example, to change the way arrays are converted to query strings using the `qs` module pass the `arrayFormat` option with one of `indices|brackets|repeat`\n- `useQuerystring` - If true, use `querystring` to stringify and parse\n  querystrings, otherwise use `qs` (default: `false`).  Set this option to\n  `true` if you need arrays to be serialized as `foo=bar&foo=baz` instead of the\n  default `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=baz`.\n\n---\n\n- `body` - entity body for PATCH, POST and PUT requests. Must be a `Buffer`, `String` or `ReadStream`. If `json` is `true`, then `body` must be a JSON-serializable object.\n- `form` - when passed an object or a querystring, this sets `body` to a querystring representation of value, and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header. When passed no options, a `FormData` instance is returned (and is piped to request). See "Forms" section above.\n- `formData` - Data to pass for a `multipart/form-data` request. See\n  [Forms](#forms) section above.\n- `multipart` - array of objects which contain their own headers and `body`\n  attributes. Sends a `multipart/related` request. See [Forms](#forms) section\n  above.\n  - Alternatively you can pass in an object `{chunked: false, data: []}` where\n    `chunked` is used to specify whether the request is sent in\n    [chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding)\n    In non-chunked requests, data items with body streams are not allowed.\n- `preambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF before the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.\n- `postambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF at the end of the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.\n- `json` - sets `body` to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header.  Additionally, parses the response body as JSON.\n- `jsonReviver` - a [reviver function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) that will be passed to `JSON.parse()` when parsing a JSON response body.\n- `jsonReplacer` - a [replacer function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) that will be passed to `JSON.stringify()` when stringifying a JSON request body.\n\n---\n\n- `auth` - A hash containing values `user` || `username`, `pass` || `password`, and `sendImmediately` (optional).  See documentation above.\n- `oauth` - Options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing. See documentation above.\n- `hawk` - Options for [Hawk signing](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk). The `credentials` key must contain the necessary signing info, [see hawk docs for details](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk#usage-example).\n- `aws` - `object` containing AWS signing information. Should have the properties `key`, `secret`. Also requires the property `bucket`, unless you’re specifying your `bucket` as part of the path, or the request doesn’t use a bucket (i.e. GET Services). If you want to use AWS sign version 4 use the parameter `sign_version` with value `4` otherwise the default is version 2. **Note:** you need to `npm install aws4` first.\n- `httpSignature` - Options for the [HTTP Signature Scheme](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md) using [Joyent\'s library](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature). The `keyId` and `key` properties must be specified. See the docs for other options.\n\n---\n\n- `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `true`). This property can also be implemented as function which gets `response` object as a single argument and should return `true` if redirects should continue or `false` otherwise.\n- `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `false`)\n- `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow (default: `10`)\n- `removeRefererHeader` - removes the referer header when a redirect happens (default: `false`). **Note:** if true, referer header set in the initial request is preserved during redirect chain.\n\n---\n\n- `encoding` - Encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If `null`, the `body` is returned as a `Buffer`. Anything else **(including the default value of `undefined`)** will be passed as the [encoding](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) parameter to `toString()` (meaning this is effectively `utf8` by default). (**Note:** if you expect binary data, you should set `encoding: null`.)\n- `gzip` - If `true`, add an `Accept-Encoding` header to request compressed content encodings from the server (if not already present) and decode supported content encodings in the response.  **Note:** Automatic decoding of the response content is performed on the body data returned through `request` (both through the `request` stream and passed to the callback function) but is not performed on the `response` stream (available from the `response` event) which is the unmodified `http.IncomingMessage` object which may contain compressed data. See example below.\n- `jar` - If `true`, remember cookies for future use (or define your custom cookie jar; see examples section)\n\n---\n\n- `agent` - `http(s).Agent` instance to use\n- `agentClass` - alternatively specify your agent\'s class name\n- `agentOptions` - and pass its options. **Note:** for HTTPS see [tls API doc for TLS/SSL options](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) and the [documentation above](#using-optionsagentoptions).\n- `forever` - set to `true` to use the [forever-agent](https://github.com/request/forever-agent) **Note:** Defaults to `http(s).Agent({keepAlive:true})` in node 0.12+\n- `pool` - An object describing which agents to use for the request. If this option is omitted the request will use the global agent (as long as your options allow for it). Otherwise, request will search the pool for your custom agent. If no custom agent is found, a new agent will be created and added to the pool. **Note:** `pool` is used only when the `agent` option is not specified.\n  - A `maxSockets` property can also be provided on the `pool` object to set the max number of sockets for all agents created (ex: `pool: {maxSockets: Infinity}`).\n  - Note that if you are sending multiple requests in a loop and creating\n    multiple new `pool` objects, `maxSockets` will not work as intended.  To\n    work around this, either use [`request.defaults`](#requestdefaultsoptions)\n    with your pool options or create the pool object with the `maxSockets`\n    property outside of the loop.\n- `timeout` - Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a\nserver to send response headers (and start the response body) before aborting\nthe request. Note that if the underlying TCP connection cannot be established,\nthe OS-wide TCP connection timeout will overrule the `timeout` option ([the\ndefault in Linux can be anywhere from 20-120 seconds][linux-timeout]).\n\n[linux-timeout]: http://www.sekuda.com/overriding_the_default_linux_kernel_20_second_tcp_socket_connect_timeout\n\n---\n\n- `localAddress` - Local interface to bind for network connections.\n- `proxy` - An HTTP proxy to be used. Supports proxy Auth with Basic Auth, identical to support for the `url` parameter (by embedding the auth info in the `uri`)\n- `strictSSL` - If `true`, requires SSL certificates be valid. **Note:** to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that CA as an option.\n- `tunnel` - controls the behavior of\n  [HTTP `CONNECT` tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_tunneling)\n  as follows:\n   - `undefined` (default) - `true` if the destination is `https`, `false` otherwise\n   - `true` - always tunnel to the destination by making a `CONNECT` request to\n     the proxy\n   - `false` - request the destination as a `GET` request.\n- `proxyHeaderWhiteList` - A whitelist of headers to send to a\n  tunneling proxy.\n- `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` - A whitelist of headers to send\n  exclusively to a tunneling proxy and not to destination.\n\n---\n\n- `time` - If `true`, the request-response cycle (including all redirects) is timed at millisecond resolution, and the result provided on the response\'s `elapsedTime` property.\n- `har` - A [HAR 1.2 Request Object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request), will be processed from HAR format into options overwriting matching values *(see the [HAR 1.2 section](#support-for-har-1.2) for details)*\n- `callback` - alternatively pass the request\'s callback in the options object\n\nThe callback argument gets 3 arguments:\n\n1. An `error` when applicable (usually from [`http.ClientRequest`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest) object)\n2. An [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object\n3. The third is the `response` body (`String` or `Buffer`, or JSON object if the `json` option is supplied)\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Convenience methods\n\nThere are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.\n\n\n### request.defaults(options)\n\nThis method **returns a wrapper** around the normal request API that defaults\nto whatever options you pass to it.\n\n**Note:** `request.defaults()` **does not** modify the global request API;\ninstead, it **returns a wrapper** that has your default settings applied to it.\n\n**Note:** You can call `.defaults()` on the wrapper that is returned from\n`request.defaults` to add/override defaults that were previously defaulted.\n\nFor example:\n```js\n//requests using baseRequest() will set the \'x-token\' header\nvar baseRequest = request.defaults({\n  headers: {\'x-token\': \'my-token\'}\n})\n\n//requests using specialRequest() will include the \'x-token\' header set in\n//baseRequest and will also include the \'special\' header\nvar specialRequest = baseRequest.defaults({\n  headers: {special: \'special value\'}\n})\n```\n\n### request.put\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "PUT"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.put(url)\n```\n\n### request.patch\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "PATCH"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.patch(url)\n```\n\n### request.post\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "POST"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.post(url)\n```\n\n### request.head\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.head(url)\n```\n\n### request.del / request.delete\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.del(url)\nrequest.delete(url)\n```\n\n### request.get\n\nSame as `request()` (for uniformity).\n\n```js\nrequest.get(url)\n```\n### request.cookie\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie.\n\n```js\nrequest.cookie(\'key1=value1\')\n```\n### request.jar()\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie jar.\n\n```js\nrequest.jar()\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Debugging\n\nThere are at least three ways to debug the operation of `request`:\n\n1. Launch the node process like `NODE_DEBUG=request node script.js`\n   (`lib,request,otherlib` works too).\n\n2. Set `require(\'request\').debug = true` at any time (this does the same thing\n   as #1).\n\n3. Use the [request-debug module](https://github.com/request/request-debug) to\n   view request and response headers and bodies.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Timeouts\n\nMost requests to external servers should have a timeout attached, in case the\nserver is not responding in a timely manner. Without a timeout, your code may\nhave a socket open/consume resources for minutes or more.\n\nThere are two main types of timeouts: **connection timeouts** and **read\ntimeouts**. A connect timeout occurs if the timeout is hit while your client is\nattempting to establish a connection to a remote machine (corresponding to the\n[connect() call][connect] on the socket). A read timeout occurs any time the\nserver is too slow to send back a part of the response.\n\nThese two situations have widely different implications for what went wrong\nwith the request, so it\'s useful to be able to distinguish them. You can detect\ntimeout errors by checking `err.code` for an \'ETIMEDOUT\' value. Further, you\ncan detect whether the timeout was a connection timeout by checking if the\n`err.connect` property is set to `true`.\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://10.255.255.1\', {timeout: 1500}, function(err) {\n    console.log(err.code === \'ETIMEDOUT\');\n    // Set to `true` if the timeout was a connection timeout, `false` or\n    // `undefined` otherwise.\n    console.log(err.connect === true);\n    process.exit(0);\n});\n```\n\n[connect]: http://linux.die.net/man/2/connect\n\n## Examples:\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()\n    ;\n  request(\n    { method: \'PUT\'\n    , uri: \'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\' + rand\n    , multipart:\n      [ { \'content-type\': \'application/json\'\n        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        }\n      , { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ]\n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      if(response.statusCode == 201){\n        console.log(\'document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\'+ rand)\n      } else {\n        console.log(\'error: \'+ response.statusCode)\n        console.log(body)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n```\n\nFor backwards-compatibility, response compression is not supported by default.\nTo accept gzip-compressed responses, set the `gzip` option to `true`.  Note\nthat the body data passed through `request` is automatically decompressed\nwhile the response object is unmodified and will contain compressed data if\nthe server sent a compressed response.\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n  request(\n    { method: \'GET\'\n    , uri: \'http://www.google.com\'\n    , gzip: true\n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      // body is the decompressed response body\n      console.log(\'server encoded the data as: \' + (response.headers[\'content-encoding\'] || \'identity\'))\n      console.log(\'the decoded data is: \' + body)\n    }\n  ).on(\'data\', function(data) {\n    // decompressed data as it is received\n    console.log(\'decoded chunk: \' + data)\n  })\n  .on(\'response\', function(response) {\n    // unmodified http.IncomingMessage object\n    response.on(\'data\', function(data) {\n      // compressed data as it is received\n      console.log(\'received \' + data.length + \' bytes of compressed data\')\n    })\n  })\n```\n\nCookies are disabled by default (else, they would be used in subsequent requests). To enable cookies, set `jar` to `true` (either in `defaults` or `options`).\n\n```js\nvar request = request.defaults({jar: true})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nTo use a custom cookie jar (instead of `request`’s global cookie jar), set `jar` to an instance of `request.jar()` (either in `defaults` or `options`)\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar request = request.defaults({jar:j})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nOR\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar();\nvar cookie = request.cookie(\'key1=value1\');\nvar url = \'http://www.google.com\';\nj.setCookie(cookie, url);\nrequest({url: url, jar: j}, function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nTo use a custom cookie store (such as a\n[`FileCookieStore`](https://github.com/mitsuru/tough-cookie-filestore)\nwhich supports saving to and restoring from JSON files), pass it as a parameter\nto `request.jar()`:\n\n```js\nvar FileCookieStore = require(\'tough-cookie-filestore\');\n// NOTE - currently the \'cookies.json\' file must already exist!\nvar j = request.jar(new FileCookieStore(\'cookies.json\'));\nrequest = request.defaults({ jar : j })\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function() {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nThe cookie store must be a\n[`tough-cookie`](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie)\nstore and it must support synchronous operations; see the\n[`CookieStore` API docs](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie#cookiestore-api)\nfor details.\n\nTo inspect your cookie jar after a request:\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar()\nrequest({url: \'http://www.google.com\', jar: j}, function () {\n  var cookie_string = j.getCookieString(url); // "key1=value1; key2=value2; ..."\n  var cookies = j.getCookies(url);\n  // [{key: \'key1\', value: \'value1\', domain: "www.google.com", ...}, ...]\n})\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n',

It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.\n\n```js\nvar request = require(\'request\');\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function (error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    console.log(body) // Show the HTML for the Google homepage.\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Streaming](#streaming)\n- [Forms](#forms)\n- [HTTP Authentication](#http-authentication)\n- [Custom HTTP Headers](#custom-http-headers)\n- [OAuth Signing](#oauth-signing)\n- [Proxies](#proxies)\n- [Unix Domain Sockets](#unix-domain-sockets)\n- [TLS/SSL Protocol](#tlsssl-protocol)\n- [Support for HAR 1.2](#support-for-har-12)\n- [**All Available Options**](#requestoptions-callback)\n\nRequest also offers [convenience methods](#convenience-methods) like\n`request.defaults` and `request.post`, and there are\nlots of [usage examples](#examples) and several\n[debugging techniques](#debugging).\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Streaming\n\nYou can stream any response to a file stream.\n\n```js\nrequest(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nYou can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types (in this case `application/json`) and use the proper `content-type` in the PUT request (if the headers don’t already provide one).\n\n```js\nfs.createReadStream(\'file.json\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/obj.json\'))\n```\n\nRequest can also `pipe` to itself. When doing so, `content-type` and `content-length` are preserved in the PUT headers.\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://google.com/img.png\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nRequest emits a "response" event when a response is received. The `response` argument will be an instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage).\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .get(\'http://google.com/img.png\')\n  .on(\'response\', function(response) {\n    console.log(response.statusCode) // 200\n    console.log(response.headers[\'content-type\']) // \'image/png\'\n  })\n  .pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nTo easily handle errors when streaming requests, listen to the `error` event before piping:\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n  .on(\'error\', function(err) {\n    console.log(err)\n  })\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nNow let’s get fancy.\n\n```js\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    if (req.method === \'PUT\') {\n      req.pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\'))\n    } else if (req.method === \'GET\' || req.method === \'HEAD\') {\n      request.get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can also `pipe()` from `http.ServerRequest` instances, as well as to `http.ServerResponse` instances. The HTTP method, headers, and entity-body data will be sent. Which means that, if you don\'t really care about security, you can do:\n\n```js\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    var x = request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n    req.pipe(x)\n    x.pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAnd since `pipe()` returns the destination stream in ≥ Node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying. :)\n\n```js\nreq.pipe(request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')).pipe(resp)\n```\n\nAlso, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.\n\n```js\nvar r = request.defaults({\'proxy\':\'http://localproxy.com\'})\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    r.get(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Forms\n\n`request` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads. For `multipart/related` refer to the `multipart` API.\n\n\n#### application/x-www-form-urlencoded (URL-Encoded Forms)\n\nURL-encoded forms are simple.\n\n```js\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', {form:{key:\'value\'}})\n// or\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\').form({key:\'value\'})\n// or\nrequest.post({url:\'http://service.com/upload\', form: {key:\'value\'}}, function(err,httpResponse,body){ /* ... */ })\n```\n\n\n#### multipart/form-data (Multipart Form Uploads)\n\nFor `multipart/form-data` we use the [form-data](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) library by [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge). For the most cases, you can pass your upload form data via the `formData` option.\n\n\n```js\nvar formData = {\n  // Pass a simple key-value pair\n  my_field: \'my_value\',\n  // Pass data via Buffers\n  my_buffer: new Buffer([1, 2, 3]),\n  // Pass data via Streams\n  my_file: fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/unicycle.jpg\'),\n  // Pass multiple values /w an Array\n  attachments: [\n    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/attachment1.jpg\'),\n    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/attachment2.jpg\')\n  ],\n  // Pass optional meta-data with an \'options\' object with style: {value: DATA, options: OPTIONS}\n  // Use case: for some types of streams, you\'ll need to provide "file"-related information manually.\n  // See the `form-data` README for more information about options: https://github.com/form-data/form-data\n  custom_file: {\n    value:  fs.createReadStream(\'/dev/urandom\'),\n    options: {\n      filename: \'topsecret.jpg\',\n      contentType: \'image/jpg\'\n    }\n  }\n};\nrequest.post({url:\'http://service.com/upload\', formData: formData}, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.error(\'upload failed:\', err);\n  }\n  console.log(\'Upload successful!  Server responded with:\', body);\n});\n```\n\nFor advanced cases, you can access the form-data object itself via `r.form()`. This can be modified until the request is fired on the next cycle of the event-loop. (Note that this calling `form()` will clear the currently set form data for that request.)\n\n```js\n// NOTE: Advanced use-case, for normal use see \'formData\' usage above\nvar r = request.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {...})\nvar form = r.form();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my_value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer([1, 2, 3]));\nform.append(\'custom_file\', fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/unicycle.jpg\'), {filename: \'unicycle.jpg\'});\n```\nSee the [form-data README](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) for more information & examples.\n\n\n#### multipart/related\n\nSome variations in different HTTP implementations require a newline/CRLF before, after, or both before and after the boundary of a `multipart/related` request (using the multipart option). This has been observed in the .NET WebAPI version 4.0. You can turn on a boundary preambleCRLF or postamble by passing them as `true` to your request options.\n\n```js\n  request({\n    method: \'PUT\',\n    preambleCRLF: true,\n    postambleCRLF: true,\n    uri: \'http://service.com/upload\',\n    multipart: [\n      {\n        \'content-type\': \'application/json\',\n        body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n      },\n      { body: \'I am an attachment\' },\n      { body: fs.createReadStream(\'image.png\') }\n    ],\n    // alternatively pass an object containing additional options\n    multipart: {\n      chunked: false,\n      data: [\n        {\n          \'content-type\': \'application/json\',\n          body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        },\n        { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  function (error, response, body) {\n    if (error) {\n      return console.error(\'upload failed:\', error);\n    }\n    console.log(\'Upload successful!  Server responded with:\', body);\n  })\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## HTTP Authentication\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\').auth(\'username\', \'password\', false);\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'user\': \'username\',\n    \'pass\': \'password\',\n    \'sendImmediately\': false\n  }\n});\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\').auth(null, null, true, \'bearerToken\');\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'bearer\': \'bearerToken\'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf passed as an option, `auth` should be a hash containing values:\n\n- `user` || `username`\n- `pass` || `password`\n- `sendImmediately` (optional)\n- `bearer` (optional)\n\nThe method form takes parameters\n`auth(username, password, sendImmediately, bearer)`.\n\n`sendImmediately` defaults to `true`, which causes a basic or bearer\nauthentication header to be sent.  If `sendImmediately` is `false`, then\n`request` will retry with a proper authentication header after receiving a\n`401` response from the server (which must contain a `WWW-Authenticate` header\nindicating the required authentication method).\n\nNote that you can also specify basic authentication using the URL itself, as\ndetailed in [RFC 1738](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt).  Simply pass the\n`user:password` before the host with an `@` sign:\n\n```js\nvar username = \'username\',\n    password = \'password\',\n    url = \'http://\' + username + \':\' + password + \'@some.server.com\';\n\nrequest({url: url}, function (error, response, body) {\n   // Do more stuff with \'body\' here\n});\n```\n\nDigest authentication is supported, but it only works with `sendImmediately`\nset to `false`; otherwise `request` will send basic authentication on the\ninitial request, which will probably cause the request to fail.\n\nBearer authentication is supported, and is activated when the `bearer` value is\navailable. The value may be either a `String` or a `Function` returning a\n`String`. Using a function to supply the bearer token is particularly useful if\nused in conjunction with `defaults` to allow a single function to supply the\nlast known token at the time of sending a request, or to compute one on the fly.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Custom HTTP Headers\n\nHTTP Headers, such as `User-Agent`, can be set in the `options` object.\nIn the example below, we call the github API to find out the number\nof stars and forks for the request repository. This requires a\ncustom `User-Agent` header as well as https.\n\n```js\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n  url: \'https://api.github.com/repos/request/request\',\n  headers: {\n    \'User-Agent\': \'request\'\n  }\n};\n\nfunction callback(error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    var info = JSON.parse(body);\n    console.log(info.stargazers_count + " Stars");\n    console.log(info.forks_count + " Forks");\n  }\n}\n\nrequest(options, callback);\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## OAuth Signing\n\n[OAuth version 1.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849) is supported.  The\ndefault signing algorithm is\n[HMAC-SHA1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.2):\n\n```js\n// OAuth1.0 - 3-legged server side flow (Twitter example)\n// step 1\nvar qs = require(\'querystring\')\n  , oauth =\n    { callback: \'http://mysite.com/callback/\'\n    , consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n    , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n    }\n  , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token\'\n  ;\nrequest.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n  // Ideally, you would take the body in the response\n  // and construct a URL that a user clicks on (like a sign in button).\n  // The verifier is only available in the response after a user has\n  // verified with twitter that they are authorizing your app.\n\n  // step 2\n  var req_data = qs.parse(body)\n  var uri = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate\'\n    + \'?\' + qs.stringify({oauth_token: req_data.oauth_token})\n  // redirect the user to the authorize uri\n\n  // step 3\n  // after the user is redirected back to your server\n  var auth_data = qs.parse(body)\n    , oauth =\n      { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n      , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n      , token: auth_data.oauth_token\n      , token_secret: req_data.oauth_token_secret\n      , verifier: auth_data.oauth_verifier\n      }\n    , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token\'\n    ;\n  request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n    // ready to make signed requests on behalf of the user\n    var perm_data = qs.parse(body)\n      , oauth =\n        { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n        , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n        , token: perm_data.oauth_token\n        , token_secret: perm_data.oauth_token_secret\n        }\n      , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/show.json\'\n      , qs =\n        { screen_name: perm_data.screen_name\n        , user_id: perm_data.user_id\n        }\n      ;\n    request.get({url:url, oauth:oauth, qs:qs, json:true}, function (e, r, user) {\n      console.log(user)\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\nFor [RSA-SHA1 signing](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.3), make\nthe following changes to the OAuth options object:\n* Pass `signature_method : \'RSA-SHA1\'`\n* Instead of `consumer_secret`, specify a `private_key` string in\n  [PEM format](http://how2ssl.com/articles/working_with_pem_files/)\n\nFor [PLAINTEXT signing](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#anchor22), make\nthe following changes to the OAuth options object:\n* Pass `signature_method : \'PLAINTEXT\'`\n\nTo send OAuth parameters via query params or in a post body as described in The\n[Consumer Request Parameters](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#consumer_req_param)\nsection of the oauth1 spec:\n* Pass `transport_method : \'query\'` or `transport_method : \'body\'` in the OAuth\n  options object.\n* `transport_method` defaults to `\'header\'`\n\nTo use [Request Body Hash](https://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/spec/ext/body_hash/1.0/oauth-bodyhash.html) you can either\n* Manually generate the body hash and pass it as a string `body_hash: \'...\'`\n* Automatically generate the body hash by passing `body_hash: true`\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Proxies\n\nIf you specify a `proxy` option, then the request (and any subsequent\nredirects) will be sent via a connection to the proxy server.\n\nIf your endpoint is an `https` url, and you are using a proxy, then\nrequest will send a `CONNECT` request to the proxy server *first*, and\nthen use the supplied connection to connect to the endpoint.\n\nThat is, first it will make a request like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 CONNECT endpoint-server.com:80\nHost: proxy-server.com\nUser-Agent: whatever user agent you specify\n```\n\nand then the proxy server make a TCP connection to `endpoint-server`\non port `80`, and return a response that looks like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n```\n\nAt this point, the connection is left open, and the client is\ncommunicating directly with the `endpoint-server.com` machine.\n\nSee [the wikipedia page on HTTP Tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel)\nfor more information.\n\nBy default, when proxying `http` traffic, request will simply make a\nstandard proxied `http` request.  This is done by making the `url`\nsection of the initial line of the request a fully qualified url to\nthe endpoint.\n\nFor example, it will make a single request that looks like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 GET http://endpoint-server.com/some-url\nHost: proxy-server.com\nOther-Headers: all go here\n\nrequest body or whatever\n```\n\nBecause a pure "http over http" tunnel offers no additional security\nor other features, it is generally simpler to go with a\nstraightforward HTTP proxy in this case.  However, if you would like\nto force a tunneling proxy, you may set the `tunnel` option to `true`.\n\nYou can also make a standard proxied `http` request by explicitly setting\n`tunnel : false`, but **note that this will allow the proxy to see the traffic\nto/from the destination server**.\n\nIf you are using a tunneling proxy, you may set the\n`proxyHeaderWhiteList` to share certain headers with the proxy.\n\nYou can also set the `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` to share certain\nheaders only with the proxy and not with destination host.\n\nBy default, this set is:\n\n```\naccept\naccept-charset\naccept-encoding\naccept-language\naccept-ranges\ncache-control\ncontent-encoding\ncontent-language\ncontent-length\ncontent-location\ncontent-md5\ncontent-range\ncontent-type\nconnection\ndate\nexpect\nmax-forwards\npragma\nproxy-authorization\nreferer\nte\ntransfer-encoding\nuser-agent\nvia\n```\n\nNote that, when using a tunneling proxy, the `proxy-authorization`\nheader and any headers from custom `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` are\n*never* sent to the endpoint server, but only to the proxy server.\n\n\n### Controlling proxy behaviour using environment variables\n\nThe following environment variables are respected by `request`:\n\n * `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy`\n * `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`\n * `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy`\n\nWhen `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy` are set, they will be used to proxy non-SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option present. Similarly, `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy` will be respected for SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option. It is valid to define a proxy in one of the environment variables, but then override it for a specific request, using the `proxy` configuration option. Furthermore, the `proxy` configuration option can be explicitly set to false / null to opt out of proxying altogether for that request.\n\n`request` is also aware of the `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` environment variables. These variables provide a granular way to opt out of proxying, on a per-host basis. It should contain a comma separated list of hosts to opt out of proxying. It is also possible to opt of proxying when a particular destination port is used. Finally, the variable may be set to `*` to opt out of the implicit proxy configuration of the other environment variables.\n\nHere\'s some examples of valid `no_proxy` values:\n\n * `google.com` - don\'t proxy HTTP/HTTPS requests to Google.\n * `google.com:443` - don\'t proxy HTTPS requests to Google, but *do* proxy HTTP requests to Google.\n * `google.com:443, yahoo.com:80` - don\'t proxy HTTPS requests to Google, and don\'t proxy HTTP requests to Yahoo!\n * `*` - ignore `https_proxy`/`http_proxy` environment variables altogether.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## UNIX Domain Sockets\n\n`request` supports making requests to [UNIX Domain Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket). To make one, use the following URL scheme:\n\n```js\n/* Pattern */ \'http://unix:SOCKET:PATH\'\n/* Example */ request.get(\'http://unix:/absolute/path/to/unix.socket:/request/path\')\n```\n\nNote: The `SOCKET` path is assumed to be absolute to the root of the host file system.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## TLS/SSL Protocol\n\nTLS/SSL Protocol options, such as `cert`, `key` and `passphrase`, can be\nset directly in `options` object, in the `agentOptions` property of the `options` object, or even in `https.globalAgent.options`. Keep in mind that, although `agentOptions` allows for a slightly wider range of configurations, the recommended way is via `options` object directly, as using `agentOptions` or `https.globalAgent.options` would not be applied in the same way in proxied environments (as data travels through a TLS connection instead of an http/https agent).\n\n```js\nvar fs = require(\'fs\')\n    , path = require(\'path\')\n    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.crt\')\n    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.key\')\n    , caFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/ca.cert.pem\')\n    , request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),\n    key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),\n    passphrase: \'password\',\n    ca: fs.readFileSync(caFile)\n};\n\nrequest.get(options);\n```\n\n### Using `options.agentOptions`\n\nIn the example below, we call an API requires client side SSL certificate\n(in PEM format) with passphrase protected private key (in PEM format) and disable the SSLv3 protocol:\n\n```js\nvar fs = require(\'fs\')\n    , path = require(\'path\')\n    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.crt\')\n    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.key\')\n    , request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),\n        key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),\n        // Or use `pfx` property replacing `cert` and `key` when using private key, certificate and CA certs in PFX or PKCS12 format:\n        // pfx: fs.readFileSync(pfxFilePath),\n        passphrase: \'password\',\n        securityOptions: \'SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3\'\n    }\n};\n\nrequest.get(options);\n```\n\nIt is able to force using SSLv3 only by specifying `secureProtocol`:\n\n```js\nrequest.get({\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        secureProtocol: \'SSLv3_method\'\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIt is possible to accept other certificates than those signed by generally allowed Certificate Authorities (CAs).\nThis can be useful, for example,  when using self-signed certificates.\nTo require a different root certificate, you can specify the signing CA by adding the contents of the CA\'s certificate file to the `agentOptions`.\nThe certificate the domain presents must be signed by the root certificate specified:\n\n```js\nrequest.get({\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        ca: fs.readFileSync(\'ca.cert.pem\')\n    }\n});\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Support for HAR 1.2\n\nThe `options.har` property will override the values: `url`, `method`, `qs`, `headers`, `form`, `formData`, `body`, `json`, as well as construct multipart data and read files from disk when `request.postData.params[].fileName` is present without a matching `value`.\n\na validation step will check if the HAR Request format matches the latest spec (v1.2) and will skip parsing if not matching.\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n  request({\n    // will be ignored\n    method: \'GET\',\n    uri: \'http://www.google.com\',\n\n    // HTTP Archive Request Object\n    har: {\n      url: \'http://www.mockbin.com/har\',\n      method: \'POST\',\n      headers: [\n        {\n          name: \'content-type\',\n          value: \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n        }\n      ],\n      postData: {\n        mimeType: \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\',\n        params: [\n          {\n            name: \'foo\',\n            value: \'bar\'\n          },\n          {\n            name: \'hello\',\n            value: \'world\'\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  })\n\n  // a POST request will be sent to http://www.mockbin.com\n  // with body an application/x-www-form-urlencoded body:\n  // foo=bar&hello=world\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## request(options, callback)\n\nThe first argument can be either a `url` or an `options` object. The only required option is `uri`; all others are optional.\n\n- `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from `url.parse()`\n- `baseUrl` - fully qualified uri string used as the base url. Most useful with `request.defaults`, for example when you want to do many requests to the same domain.  If `baseUrl` is `https://example.com/api/`, then requesting `/end/point?test=true` will fetch `https://example.com/api/end/point?test=true`. When `baseUrl` is given, `uri` must also be a string.\n- `method` - http method (default: `"GET"`)\n- `headers` - http headers (default: `{}`)\n\n---\n\n- `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the `uri`\n- `qsParseOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.parse](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#parsing-objects) method. Alternatively pass options to the [querystring.parse](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_parse_str_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:\';\', eq:\':\', options:{}}`\n- `qsStringifyOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.stringify](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#stringifying) method. Alternatively pass options to the  [querystring.stringify](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_stringify_obj_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:\';\', eq:\':\', options:{}}`. For example, to change the way arrays are converted to query strings using the `qs` module pass the `arrayFormat` option with one of `indices|brackets|repeat`\n- `useQuerystring` - If true, use `querystring` to stringify and parse\n  querystrings, otherwise use `qs` (default: `false`).  Set this option to\n  `true` if you need arrays to be serialized as `foo=bar&foo=baz` instead of the\n  default `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=baz`.\n\n---\n\n- `body` - entity body for PATCH, POST and PUT requests. Must be a `Buffer`, `String` or `ReadStream`. If `json` is `true`, then `body` must be a JSON-serializable object.\n- `form` - when passed an object or a querystring, this sets `body` to a querystring representation of value, and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header. When passed no options, a `FormData` instance is returned (and is piped to request). See "Forms" section above.\n- `formData` - Data to pass for a `multipart/form-data` request. See\n  [Forms](#forms) section above.\n- `multipart` - array of objects which contain their own headers and `body`\n  attributes. Sends a `multipart/related` request. See [Forms](#forms) section\n  above.\n  - Alternatively you can pass in an object `{chunked: false, data: []}` where\n    `chunked` is used to specify whether the request is sent in\n    [chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding)\n    In non-chunked requests, data items with body streams are not allowed.\n- `preambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF before the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.\n- `postambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF at the end of the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.\n- `json` - sets `body` to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header.  Additionally, parses the response body as JSON.\n- `jsonReviver` - a [reviver function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) that will be passed to `JSON.parse()` when parsing a JSON response body.\n- `jsonReplacer` - a [replacer function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) that will be passed to `JSON.stringify()` when stringifying a JSON request body.\n\n---\n\n- `auth` - A hash containing values `user` || `username`, `pass` || `password`, and `sendImmediately` (optional).  See documentation above.\n- `oauth` - Options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing. See documentation above.\n- `hawk` - Options for [Hawk signing](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk). The `credentials` key must contain the necessary signing info, [see hawk docs for details](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk#usage-example).\n- `aws` - `object` containing AWS signing information. Should have the properties `key`, `secret`. Also requires the property `bucket`, unless you’re specifying your `bucket` as part of the path, or the request doesn’t use a bucket (i.e. GET Services). If you want to use AWS sign version 4 use the parameter `sign_version` with value `4` otherwise the default is version 2. **Note:** you need to `npm install aws4` first.\n- `httpSignature` - Options for the [HTTP Signature Scheme](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md) using [Joyent\'s library](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature). The `keyId` and `key` properties must be specified. See the docs for other options.\n\n---\n\n- `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `true`). This property can also be implemented as function which gets `response` object as a single argument and should return `true` if redirects should continue or `false` otherwise.\n- `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `false`)\n- `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow (default: `10`)\n- `removeRefererHeader` - removes the referer header when a redirect happens (default: `false`). **Note:** if true, referer header set in the initial request is preserved during redirect chain.\n\n---\n\n- `encoding` - Encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If `null`, the `body` is returned as a `Buffer`. Anything else **(including the default value of `undefined`)** will be passed as the [encoding](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) parameter to `toString()` (meaning this is effectively `utf8` by default). (**Note:** if you expect binary data, you should set `encoding: null`.)\n- `gzip` - If `true`, add an `Accept-Encoding` header to request compressed content encodings from the server (if not already present) and decode supported content encodings in the response.  **Note:** Automatic decoding of the response content is performed on the body data returned through `request` (both through the `request` stream and passed to the callback function) but is not performed on the `response` stream (available from the `response` event) which is the unmodified `http.IncomingMessage` object which may contain compressed data. See example below.\n- `jar` - If `true`, remember cookies for future use (or define your custom cookie jar; see examples section)\n\n---\n\n- `agent` - `http(s).Agent` instance to use\n- `agentClass` - alternatively specify your agent\'s class name\n- `agentOptions` - and pass its options. **Note:** for HTTPS see [tls API doc for TLS/SSL options](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) and the [documentation above](#using-optionsagentoptions).\n- `forever` - set to `true` to use the [forever-agent](https://github.com/request/forever-agent) **Note:** Defaults to `http(s).Agent({keepAlive:true})` in node 0.12+\n- `pool` - An object describing which agents to use for the request. If this option is omitted the request will use the global agent (as long as your options allow for it). Otherwise, request will search the pool for your custom agent. If no custom agent is found, a new agent will be created and added to the pool. **Note:** `pool` is used only when the `agent` option is not specified.\n  - A `maxSockets` property can also be provided on the `pool` object to set the max number of sockets for all agents created (ex: `pool: {maxSockets: Infinity}`).\n  - Note that if you are sending multiple requests in a loop and creating\n    multiple new `pool` objects, `maxSockets` will not work as intended.  To\n    work around this, either use [`request.defaults`](#requestdefaultsoptions)\n    with your pool options or create the pool object with the `maxSockets`\n    property outside of the loop.\n- `timeout` - Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a\nserver to send response headers (and start the response body) before aborting\nthe request. Note that if the underlying TCP connection cannot be established,\nthe OS-wide TCP connection timeout will overrule the `timeout` option ([the\ndefault in Linux can be anywhere from 20-120 seconds][linux-timeout]).\n\n[linux-timeout]: http://www.sekuda.com/overriding_the_default_linux_kernel_20_second_tcp_socket_connect_timeout\n\n---\n\n- `localAddress` - Local interface to bind for network connections.\n- `proxy` - An HTTP proxy to be used. Supports proxy Auth with Basic Auth, identical to support for the `url` parameter (by embedding the auth info in the `uri`)\n- `strictSSL` - If `true`, requires SSL certificates be valid. **Note:** to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that CA as an option.\n- `tunnel` - controls the behavior of\n  [HTTP `CONNECT` tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_tunneling)\n  as follows:\n   - `undefined` (default) - `true` if the destination is `https`, `false` otherwise\n   - `true` - always tunnel to the destination by making a `CONNECT` request to\n     the proxy\n   - `false` - request the destination as a `GET` request.\n- `proxyHeaderWhiteList` - A whitelist of headers to send to a\n  tunneling proxy.\n- `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` - A whitelist of headers to send\n  exclusively to a tunneling proxy and not to destination.\n\n---\n\n- `time` - If `true`, the request-response cycle (including all redirects) is timed at millisecond resolution, and the result provided on the response\'s `elapsedTime` property.\n- `har` - A [HAR 1.2 Request Object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request), will be processed from HAR format into options overwriting matching values *(see the [HAR 1.2 section](#support-for-har-1.2) for details)*\n- `callback` - alternatively pass the request\'s callback in the options object\n\nThe callback argument gets 3 arguments:\n\n1. An `error` when applicable (usually from [`http.ClientRequest`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest) object)\n2. An [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object\n3. The third is the `response` body (`String` or `Buffer`, or JSON object if the `json` option is supplied)\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Convenience methods\n\nThere are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.\n\n\n### request.defaults(options)\n\nThis method **returns a wrapper** around the normal request API that defaults\nto whatever options you pass to it.\n\n**Note:** `request.defaults()` **does not** modify the global request API;\ninstead, it **returns a wrapper** that has your default settings applied to it.\n\n**Note:** You can call `.defaults()` on the wrapper that is returned from\n`request.defaults` to add/override defaults that were previously defaulted.\n\nFor example:\n```js\n//requests using baseRequest() will set the \'x-token\' header\nvar baseRequest = request.defaults({\n  headers: {\'x-token\': \'my-token\'}\n})\n\n//requests using specialRequest() will include the \'x-token\' header set in\n//baseRequest and will also include the \'special\' header\nvar specialRequest = baseRequest.defaults({\n  headers: {special: \'special value\'}\n})\n```\n\n### request.put\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "PUT"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.put(url)\n```\n\n### request.patch\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "PATCH"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.patch(url)\n```\n\n### request.post\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "POST"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.post(url)\n```\n\n### request.head\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.head(url)\n```\n\n### request.del / request.delete\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.del(url)\nrequest.delete(url)\n```\n\n### request.get\n\nSame as `request()` (for uniformity).\n\n```js\nrequest.get(url)\n```\n### request.cookie\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie.\n\n```js\nrequest.cookie(\'key1=value1\')\n```\n### request.jar()\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie jar.\n\n```js\nrequest.jar()\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Debugging\n\nThere are at least three ways to debug the operation of `request`:\n\n1. Launch the node process like `NODE_DEBUG=request node script.js`\n   (`lib,request,otherlib` works too).\n\n2. Set `require(\'request\').debug = true` at any time (this does the same thing\n   as #1).\n\n3. Use the [request-debug module](https://github.com/request/request-debug) to\n   view request and response headers and bodies.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Timeouts\n\nMost requests to external servers should have a timeout attached, in case the\nserver is not responding in a timely manner. Without a timeout, your code may\nhave a socket open/consume resources for minutes or more.\n\nThere are two main types of timeouts: **connection timeouts** and **read\ntimeouts**. A connect timeout occurs if the timeout is hit while your client is\nattempting to establish a connection to a remote machine (corresponding to the\n[connect() call][connect] on the socket). A read timeout occurs any time the\nserver is too slow to send back a part of the response.\n\nThese two situations have widely different implications for what went wrong\nwith the request, so it\'s useful to be able to distinguish them. You can detect\ntimeout errors by checking `err.code` for an \'ETIMEDOUT\' value. Further, you\ncan detect whether the timeout was a connection timeout by checking if the\n`err.connect` property is set to `true`.\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://10.255.255.1\', {timeout: 1500}, function(err) {\n    console.log(err.code === \'ETIMEDOUT\');\n    // Set to `true` if the timeout was a connection timeout, `false` or\n    // `undefined` otherwise.\n    console.log(err.connect === true);\n    process.exit(0);\n});\n```\n\n[connect]: http://linux.die.net/man/2/connect\n\n## Examples:\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()\n    ;\n  request(\n    { method: \'PUT\'\n    , uri: \'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\' + rand\n    , multipart:\n      [ { \'content-type\': \'application/json\'\n        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        }\n      , { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ]\n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      if(response.statusCode == 201){\n        console.log(\'document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\'+ rand)\n      } else {\n        console.log(\'error: \'+ response.statusCode)\n        console.log(body)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n```\n\nFor backwards-compatibility, response compression is not supported by default.\nTo accept gzip-compressed responses, set the `gzip` option to `true`.  Note\nthat the body data passed through `request` is automatically decompressed\nwhile the response object is unmodified and will contain compressed data if\nthe server sent a compressed response.\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n  request(\n    { method: \'GET\'\n    , uri: \'http://www.google.com\'\n    , gzip: true\n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      // body is the decompressed response body\n      console.log(\'server encoded the data as: \' + (response.headers[\'content-encoding\'] || \'identity\'))\n      console.log(\'the decoded data is: \' + body)\n    }\n  ).on(\'data\', function(data) {\n    // decompressed data as it is received\n    console.log(\'decoded chunk: \' + data)\n  })\n  .on(\'response\', function(response) {\n    // unmodified http.IncomingMessage object\n    response.on(\'data\', function(data) {\n      // compressed data as it is received\n      console.log(\'received \' + data.length + \' bytes of compressed data\')\n    })\n  })\n```\n\nCookies are disabled by default (else, they would be used in subsequent requests). To enable cookies, set `jar` to `true` (either in `defaults` or `options`).\n\n```js\nvar request = request.defaults({jar: true})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nTo use a custom cookie jar (instead of `request`’s global cookie jar), set `jar` to an instance of `request.jar()` (either in `defaults` or `options`)\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar request = request.defaults({jar:j})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nOR\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar();\nvar cookie = request.cookie(\'key1=value1\');\nvar url = \'http://www.google.com\';\nj.setCookie(cookie, url);\nrequest({url: url, jar: j}, function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nTo use a custom cookie store (such as a\n[`FileCookieStore`](https://github.com/mitsuru/tough-cookie-filestore)\nwhich supports saving to and restoring from JSON files), pass it as a parameter\nto `request.jar()`:\n\n```js\nvar FileCookieStore = require(\'tough-cookie-filestore\');\n// NOTE - currently the \'cookies.json\' file must already exist!\nvar j = request.jar(new FileCookieStore(\'cookies.json\'));\nrequest = request.defaults({ jar : j })\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function() {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nThe cookie store must be a\n[`tough-cookie`](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie)\nstore and it must support synchronous operations; see the\n[`CookieStore` API docs](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie#cookiestore-api)\nfor details.\n\nTo inspect your cookie jar after a request:\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar()\nrequest({url: \'http://www.google.com\', jar: j}, function () {\n  var cookie_string = j.getCookieString(url); // "key1=value1; key2=value2; ..."\n  var cookies = j.getCookies(url);\n  // [{key: \'key1\', value: \'value1\', domain: "www.google.com", ...}, ...]\n})\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n',

It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.\n\n```js\nvar request = require(\'request\');\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function (error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    console.log(body) // Show the HTML for the Google homepage.\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Streaming](#streaming)\n- [Forms](#forms)\n- [HTTP Authentication](#http-authentication)\n- [Custom HTTP Headers](#custom-http-headers)\n- [OAuth Signing](#oauth-signing)\n- [Proxies](#proxies)\n- [Unix Domain Sockets](#unix-domain-sockets)\n- [TLS/SSL Protocol](#tlsssl-protocol)\n- [Support for HAR 1.2](#support-for-har-12)\n- [**All Available Options**](#requestoptions-callback)\n\nRequest also offers [convenience methods](#convenience-methods) like\n`request.defaults` and `request.post`, and there are\nlots of [usage examples](#examples) and several\n[debugging techniques](#debugging).\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Streaming\n\nYou can stream any response to a file stream.\n\n```js\nrequest(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nYou can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types (in this case `application/json`) and use the proper `content-type` in the PUT request (if the headers don’t already provide one).\n\n```js\nfs.createReadStream(\'file.json\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/obj.json\'))\n```\n\nRequest can also `pipe` to itself. When doing so, `content-type` and `content-length` are preserved in the PUT headers.\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://google.com/img.png\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nRequest emits a "response" event when a response is received. The `response` argument will be an instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage).\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .get(\'http://google.com/img.png\')\n  .on(\'response\', function(response) {\n    console.log(response.statusCode) // 200\n    console.log(response.headers[\'content-type\']) // \'image/png\'\n  })\n  .pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nTo easily handle errors when streaming requests, listen to the `error` event before piping:\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n  .on(\'error\', function(err) {\n    console.log(err)\n  })\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nNow let’s get fancy.\n\n```js\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    if (req.method === \'PUT\') {\n      req.pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\'))\n    } else if (req.method === \'GET\' || req.method === \'HEAD\') {\n      request.get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can also `pipe()` from `http.ServerRequest` instances, as well as to `http.ServerResponse` instances. The HTTP method, headers, and entity-body data will be sent. Which means that, if you don\'t really care about security, you can do:\n\n```js\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    var x = request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n    req.pipe(x)\n    x.pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAnd since `pipe()` returns the destination stream in ≥ Node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying. :)\n\n```js\nreq.pipe(request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')).pipe(resp)\n```\n\nAlso, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.\n\n```js\nvar r = request.defaults({\'proxy\':\'http://localproxy.com\'})\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    r.get(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Forms\n\n`request` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads. For `multipart/related` refer to the `multipart` API.\n\n\n#### application/x-www-form-urlencoded (URL-Encoded Forms)\n\nURL-encoded forms are simple.\n\n```js\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', {form:{key:\'value\'}})\n// or\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\').form({key:\'value\'})\n// or\nrequest.post({url:\'http://service.com/upload\', form: {key:\'value\'}}, function(err,httpResponse,body){ /* ... */ })\n```\n\n\n#### multipart/form-data (Multipart Form Uploads)\n\nFor `multipart/form-data` we use the [form-data](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) library by [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge). For the most cases, you can pass your upload form data via the `formData` option.\n\n\n```js\nvar formData = {\n  // Pass a simple key-value pair\n  my_field: \'my_value\',\n  // Pass data via Buffers\n  my_buffer: new Buffer([1, 2, 3]),\n  // Pass data via Streams\n  my_file: fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/unicycle.jpg\'),\n  // Pass multiple values /w an Array\n  attachments: [\n    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/attachment1.jpg\'),\n    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/attachment2.jpg\')\n  ],\n  // Pass optional meta-data with an \'options\' object with style: {value: DATA, options: OPTIONS}\n  // Use case: for some types of streams, you\'ll need to provide "file"-related information manually.\n  // See the `form-data` README for more information about options: https://github.com/form-data/form-data\n  custom_file: {\n    value:  fs.createReadStream(\'/dev/urandom\'),\n    options: {\n      filename: \'topsecret.jpg\',\n      contentType: \'image/jpg\'\n    }\n  }\n};\nrequest.post({url:\'http://service.com/upload\', formData: formData}, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.error(\'upload failed:\', err);\n  }\n  console.log(\'Upload successful!  Server responded with:\', body);\n});\n```\n\nFor advanced cases, you can access the form-data object itself via `r.form()`. This can be modified until the request is fired on the next cycle of the event-loop. (Note that this calling `form()` will clear the currently set form data for that request.)\n\n```js\n// NOTE: Advanced use-case, for normal use see \'formData\' usage above\nvar r = request.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {...})\nvar form = r.form();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my_value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer([1, 2, 3]));\nform.append(\'custom_file\', fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/unicycle.jpg\'), {filename: \'unicycle.jpg\'});\n```\nSee the [form-data README](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) for more information & examples.\n\n\n#### multipart/related\n\nSome variations in different HTTP implementations require a newline/CRLF before, after, or both before and after the boundary of a `multipart/related` request (using the multipart option). This has been observed in the .NET WebAPI version 4.0. You can turn on a boundary preambleCRLF or postamble by passing them as `true` to your request options.\n\n```js\n  request({\n    method: \'PUT\',\n    preambleCRLF: true,\n    postambleCRLF: true,\n    uri: \'http://service.com/upload\',\n    multipart: [\n      {\n        \'content-type\': \'application/json\',\n        body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n      },\n      { body: \'I am an attachment\' },\n      { body: fs.createReadStream(\'image.png\') }\n    ],\n    // alternatively pass an object containing additional options\n    multipart: {\n      chunked: false,\n      data: [\n        {\n          \'content-type\': \'application/json\',\n          body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        },\n        { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  function (error, response, body) {\n    if (error) {\n      return console.error(\'upload failed:\', error);\n    }\n    console.log(\'Upload successful!  Server responded with:\', body);\n  })\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## HTTP Authentication\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\').auth(\'username\', \'password\', false);\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'user\': \'username\',\n    \'pass\': \'password\',\n    \'sendImmediately\': false\n  }\n});\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\').auth(null, null, true, \'bearerToken\');\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'bearer\': \'bearerToken\'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf passed as an option, `auth` should be a hash containing values:\n\n- `user` || `username`\n- `pass` || `password`\n- `sendImmediately` (optional)\n- `bearer` (optional)\n\nThe method form takes parameters\n`auth(username, password, sendImmediately, bearer)`.\n\n`sendImmediately` defaults to `true`, which causes a basic or bearer\nauthentication header to be sent.  If `sendImmediately` is `false`, then\n`request` will retry with a proper authentication header after receiving a\n`401` response from the server (which must contain a `WWW-Authenticate` header\nindicating the required authentication method).\n\nNote that you can also specify basic authentication using the URL itself, as\ndetailed in [RFC 1738](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt).  Simply pass the\n`user:password` before the host with an `@` sign:\n\n```js\nvar username = \'username\',\n    password = \'password\',\n    url = \'http://\' + username + \':\' + password + \'@some.server.com\';\n\nrequest({url: url}, function (error, response, body) {\n   // Do more stuff with \'body\' here\n});\n```\n\nDigest authentication is supported, but it only works with `sendImmediately`\nset to `false`; otherwise `request` will send basic authentication on the\ninitial request, which will probably cause the request to fail.\n\nBearer authentication is supported, and is activated when the `bearer` value is\navailable. The value may be either a `String` or a `Function` returning a\n`String`. Using a function to supply the bearer token is particularly useful if\nused in conjunction with `defaults` to allow a single function to supply the\nlast known token at the time of sending a request, or to compute one on the fly.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Custom HTTP Headers\n\nHTTP Headers, such as `User-Agent`, can be set in the `options` object.\nIn the example below, we call the github API to find out the number\nof stars and forks for the request repository. This requires a\ncustom `User-Agent` header as well as https.\n\n```js\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n  url: \'https://api.github.com/repos/request/request\',\n  headers: {\n    \'User-Agent\': \'request\'\n  }\n};\n\nfunction callback(error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    var info = JSON.parse(body);\n    console.log(info.stargazers_count + " Stars");\n    console.log(info.forks_count + " Forks");\n  }\n}\n\nrequest(options, callback);\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## OAuth Signing\n\n[OAuth version 1.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849) is supported.  The\ndefault signing algorithm is\n[HMAC-SHA1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.2):\n\n```js\n// OAuth1.0 - 3-legged server side flow (Twitter example)\n// step 1\nvar qs = require(\'querystring\')\n  , oauth =\n    { callback: \'http://mysite.com/callback/\'\n    , consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n    , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n    }\n  , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token\'\n  ;\nrequest.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n  // Ideally, you would take the body in the response\n  // and construct a URL that a user clicks on (like a sign in button).\n  // The verifier is only available in the response after a user has\n  // verified with twitter that they are authorizing your app.\n\n  // step 2\n  var req_data = qs.parse(body)\n  var uri = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate\'\n    + \'?\' + qs.stringify({oauth_token: req_data.oauth_token})\n  // redirect the user to the authorize uri\n\n  // step 3\n  // after the user is redirected back to your server\n  var auth_data = qs.parse(body)\n    , oauth =\n      { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n      , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n      , token: auth_data.oauth_token\n      , token_secret: req_data.oauth_token_secret\n      , verifier: auth_data.oauth_verifier\n      }\n    , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token\'\n    ;\n  request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n    // ready to make signed requests on behalf of the user\n    var perm_data = qs.parse(body)\n      , oauth =\n        { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n        , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n        , token: perm_data.oauth_token\n        , token_secret: perm_data.oauth_token_secret\n        }\n      , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/show.json\'\n      , qs =\n        { screen_name: perm_data.screen_name\n        , user_id: perm_data.user_id\n        }\n      ;\n    request.get({url:url, oauth:oauth, qs:qs, json:true}, function (e, r, user) {\n      console.log(user)\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\nFor [RSA-SHA1 signing](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.3), make\nthe following changes to the OAuth options object:\n* Pass `signature_method : \'RSA-SHA1\'`\n* Instead of `consumer_secret`, specify a `private_key` string in\n  [PEM format](http://how2ssl.com/articles/working_with_pem_files/)\n\nFor [PLAINTEXT signing](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#anchor22), make\nthe following changes to the OAuth options object:\n* Pass `signature_method : \'PLAINTEXT\'`\n\nTo send OAuth parameters via query params or in a post body as described in The\n[Consumer Request Parameters](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#consumer_req_param)\nsection of the oauth1 spec:\n* Pass `transport_method : \'query\'` or `transport_method : \'body\'` in the OAuth\n  options object.\n* `transport_method` defaults to `\'header\'`\n\nTo use [Request Body Hash](https://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/spec/ext/body_hash/1.0/oauth-bodyhash.html) you can either\n* Manually generate the body hash and pass it as a string `body_hash: \'...\'`\n* Automatically generate the body hash by passing `body_hash: true`\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Proxies\n\nIf you specify a `proxy` option, then the request (and any subsequent\nredirects) will be sent via a connection to the proxy server.\n\nIf your endpoint is an `https` url, and you are using a proxy, then\nrequest will send a `CONNECT` request to the proxy server *first*, and\nthen use the supplied connection to connect to the endpoint.\n\nThat is, first it will make a request like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 CONNECT endpoint-server.com:80\nHost: proxy-server.com\nUser-Agent: whatever user agent you specify\n```\n\nand then the proxy server make a TCP connection to `endpoint-server`\non port `80`, and return a response that looks like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n```\n\nAt this point, the connection is left open, and the client is\ncommunicating directly with the `endpoint-server.com` machine.\n\nSee [the wikipedia page on HTTP Tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel)\nfor more information.\n\nBy default, when proxying `http` traffic, request will simply make a\nstandard proxied `http` request.  This is done by making the `url`\nsection of the initial line of the request a fully qualified url to\nthe endpoint.\n\nFor example, it will make a single request that looks like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 GET http://endpoint-server.com/some-url\nHost: proxy-server.com\nOther-Headers: all go here\n\nrequest body or whatever\n```\n\nBecause a pure "http over http" tunnel offers no additional security\nor other features, it is generally simpler to go with a\nstraightforward HTTP proxy in this case.  However, if you would like\nto force a tunneling proxy, you may set the `tunnel` option to `true`.\n\nYou can also make a standard proxied `http` request by explicitly setting\n`tunnel : false`, but **note that this will allow the proxy to see the traffic\nto/from the destination server**.\n\nIf you are using a tunneling proxy, you may set the\n`proxyHeaderWhiteList` to share certain headers with the proxy.\n\nYou can also set the `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` to share certain\nheaders only with the proxy and not with destination host.\n\nBy default, this set is:\n\n```\naccept\naccept-charset\naccept-encoding\naccept-language\naccept-ranges\ncache-control\ncontent-encoding\ncontent-language\ncontent-length\ncontent-location\ncontent-md5\ncontent-range\ncontent-type\nconnection\ndate\nexpect\nmax-forwards\npragma\nproxy-authorization\nreferer\nte\ntransfer-encoding\nuser-agent\nvia\n```\n\nNote that, when using a tunneling proxy, the `proxy-authorization`\nheader and any headers from custom `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` are\n*never* sent to the endpoint server, but only to the proxy server.\n\n\n### Controlling proxy behaviour using environment variables\n\nThe following environment variables are respected by `request`:\n\n * `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy`\n * `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`\n * `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy`\n\nWhen `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy` are set, they will be used to proxy non-SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option present. Similarly, `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy` will be respected for SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option. It is valid to define a proxy in one of the environment variables, but then override it for a specific request, using the `proxy` configuration option. Furthermore, the `proxy` configuration option can be explicitly set to false / null to opt out of proxying altogether for that request.\n\n`request` is also aware of the `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` environment variables. These variables provide a granular way to opt out of proxying, on a per-host basis. It should contain a comma separated list of hosts to opt out of proxying. It is also possible to opt of proxying when a particular destination port is used. Finally, the variable may be set to `*` to opt out of the implicit proxy configuration of the other environment variables.\n\nHere\'s some examples of valid `no_proxy` values:\n\n * `google.com` - don\'t proxy HTTP/HTTPS requests to Google.\n * `google.com:443` - don\'t proxy HTTPS requests to Google, but *do* proxy HTTP requests to Google.\n * `google.com:443, yahoo.com:80` - don\'t proxy HTTPS requests to Google, and don\'t proxy HTTP requests to Yahoo!\n * `*` - ignore `https_proxy`/`http_proxy` environment variables altogether.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## UNIX Domain Sockets\n\n`request` supports making requests to [UNIX Domain Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket). To make one, use the following URL scheme:\n\n```js\n/* Pattern */ \'http://unix:SOCKET:PATH\'\n/* Example */ request.get(\'http://unix:/absolute/path/to/unix.socket:/request/path\')\n```\n\nNote: The `SOCKET` path is assumed to be absolute to the root of the host file system.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## TLS/SSL Protocol\n\nTLS/SSL Protocol options, such as `cert`, `key` and `passphrase`, can be\nset directly in `options` object, in the `agentOptions` property of the `options` object, or even in `https.globalAgent.options`. Keep in mind that, although `agentOptions` allows for a slightly wider range of configurations, the recommended way is via `options` object directly, as using `agentOptions` or `https.globalAgent.options` would not be applied in the same way in proxied environments (as data travels through a TLS connection instead of an http/https agent).\n\n```js\nvar fs = require(\'fs\')\n    , path = require(\'path\')\n    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.crt\')\n    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.key\')\n    , caFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/ca.cert.pem\')\n    , request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),\n    key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),\n    passphrase: \'password\',\n    ca: fs.readFileSync(caFile)\n};\n\nrequest.get(options);\n```\n\n### Using `options.agentOptions`\n\nIn the example below, we call an API requires client side SSL certificate\n(in PEM format) with passphrase protected private key (in PEM format) and disable the SSLv3 protocol:\n\n```js\nvar fs = require(\'fs\')\n    , path = require(\'path\')\n    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.crt\')\n    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.key\')\n    , request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),\n        key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),\n        // Or use `pfx` property replacing `cert` and `key` when using private key, certificate and CA certs in PFX or PKCS12 format:\n        // pfx: fs.readFileSync(pfxFilePath),\n        passphrase: \'password\',\n        securityOptions: \'SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3\'\n    }\n};\n\nrequest.get(options);\n```\n\nIt is able to force using SSLv3 only by specifying `secureProtocol`:\n\n```js\nrequest.get({\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        secureProtocol: \'SSLv3_method\'\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIt is possible to accept other certificates than those signed by generally allowed Certificate Authorities (CAs).\nThis can be useful, for example,  when using self-signed certificates.\nTo require a different root certificate, you can specify the signing CA by adding the contents of the CA\'s certificate file to the `agentOptions`.\nThe certificate the domain presents must be signed by the root certificate specified:\n\n```js\nrequest.get({\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        ca: fs.readFileSync(\'ca.cert.pem\')\n    }\n});\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Support for HAR 1.2\n\nThe `options.har` property will override the values: `url`, `method`, `qs`, `headers`, `form`, `formData`, `body`, `json`, as well as construct multipart data and read files from disk when `request.postData.params[].fileName` is present without a matching `value`.\n\na validation step will check if the HAR Request format matches the latest spec (v1.2) and will skip parsing if not matching.\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n  request({\n    // will be ignored\n    method: \'GET\',\n    uri: \'http://www.google.com\',\n\n    // HTTP Archive Request Object\n    har: {\n      url: \'http://www.mockbin.com/har\',\n      method: \'POST\',\n      headers: [\n        {\n          name: \'content-type\',\n          value: \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n        }\n      ],\n      postData: {\n        mimeType: \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\',\n        params: [\n          {\n            name: \'foo\',\n            value: \'bar\'\n          },\n          {\n            name: \'hello\',\n            value: \'world\'\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  })\n\n  // a POST request will be sent to http://www.mockbin.com\n  // with body an application/x-www-form-urlencoded body:\n  // foo=bar&hello=world\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## request(options, callback)\n\nThe first argument can be either a `url` or an `options` object. The only required option is `uri`; all others are optional.\n\n- `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from `url.parse()`\n- `baseUrl` - fully qualified uri string used as the base url. Most useful with `request.defaults`, for example when you want to do many requests to the same domain.  If `baseUrl` is `https://example.com/api/`, then requesting `/end/point?test=true` will fetch `https://example.com/api/end/point?test=true`. When `baseUrl` is given, `uri` must also be a string.\n- `method` - http method (default: `"GET"`)\n- `headers` - http headers (default: `{}`)\n\n---\n\n- `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the `uri`\n- `qsParseOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.parse](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#parsing-objects) method. Alternatively pass options to the [querystring.parse](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_parse_str_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:\';\', eq:\':\', options:{}}`\n- `qsStringifyOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.stringify](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#stringifying) method. Alternatively pass options to the  [querystring.stringify](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_stringify_obj_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:\';\', eq:\':\', options:{}}`. For example, to change the way arrays are converted to query strings using the `qs` module pass the `arrayFormat` option with one of `indices|brackets|repeat`\n- `useQuerystring` - If true, use `querystring` to stringify and parse\n  querystrings, otherwise use `qs` (default: `false`).  Set this option to\n  `true` if you need arrays to be serialized as `foo=bar&foo=baz` instead of the\n  default `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=baz`.\n\n---\n\n- `body` - entity body for PATCH, POST and PUT requests. Must be a `Buffer`, `String` or `ReadStream`. If `json` is `true`, then `body` must be a JSON-serializable object.\n- `form` - when passed an object or a querystring, this sets `body` to a querystring representation of value, and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header. When passed no options, a `FormData` instance is returned (and is piped to request). See "Forms" section above.\n- `formData` - Data to pass for a `multipart/form-data` request. See\n  [Forms](#forms) section above.\n- `multipart` - array of objects which contain their own headers and `body`\n  attributes. Sends a `multipart/related` request. See [Forms](#forms) section\n  above.\n  - Alternatively you can pass in an object `{chunked: false, data: []}` where\n    `chunked` is used to specify whether the request is sent in\n    [chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding)\n    In non-chunked requests, data items with body streams are not allowed.\n- `preambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF before the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.\n- `postambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF at the end of the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.\n- `json` - sets `body` to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header.  Additionally, parses the response body as JSON.\n- `jsonReviver` - a [reviver function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) that will be passed to `JSON.parse()` when parsing a JSON response body.\n- `jsonReplacer` - a [replacer function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) that will be passed to `JSON.stringify()` when stringifying a JSON request body.\n\n---\n\n- `auth` - A hash containing values `user` || `username`, `pass` || `password`, and `sendImmediately` (optional).  See documentation above.\n- `oauth` - Options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing. See documentation above.\n- `hawk` - Options for [Hawk signing](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk). The `credentials` key must contain the necessary signing info, [see hawk docs for details](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk#usage-example).\n- `aws` - `object` containing AWS signing information. Should have the properties `key`, `secret`. Also requires the property `bucket`, unless you’re specifying your `bucket` as part of the path, or the request doesn’t use a bucket (i.e. GET Services). If you want to use AWS sign version 4 use the parameter `sign_version` with value `4` otherwise the default is version 2. **Note:** you need to `npm install aws4` first.\n- `httpSignature` - Options for the [HTTP Signature Scheme](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md) using [Joyent\'s library](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature). The `keyId` and `key` properties must be specified. See the docs for other options.\n\n---\n\n- `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `true`). This property can also be implemented as function which gets `response` object as a single argument and should return `true` if redirects should continue or `false` otherwise.\n- `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `false`)\n- `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow (default: `10`)\n- `removeRefererHeader` - removes the referer header when a redirect happens (default: `false`). **Note:** if true, referer header set in the initial request is preserved during redirect chain.\n\n---\n\n- `encoding` - Encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If `null`, the `body` is returned as a `Buffer`. Anything else **(including the default value of `undefined`)** will be passed as the [encoding](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) parameter to `toString()` (meaning this is effectively `utf8` by default). (**Note:** if you expect binary data, you should set `encoding: null`.)\n- `gzip` - If `true`, add an `Accept-Encoding` header to request compressed content encodings from the server (if not already present) and decode supported content encodings in the response.  **Note:** Automatic decoding of the response content is performed on the body data returned through `request` (both through the `request` stream and passed to the callback function) but is not performed on the `response` stream (available from the `response` event) which is the unmodified `http.IncomingMessage` object which may contain compressed data. See example below.\n- `jar` - If `true`, remember cookies for future use (or define your custom cookie jar; see examples section)\n\n---\n\n- `agent` - `http(s).Agent` instance to use\n- `agentClass` - alternatively specify your agent\'s class name\n- `agentOptions` - and pass its options. **Note:** for HTTPS see [tls API doc for TLS/SSL options](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) and the [documentation above](#using-optionsagentoptions).\n- `forever` - set to `true` to use the [forever-agent](https://github.com/request/forever-agent) **Note:** Defaults to `http(s).Agent({keepAlive:true})` in node 0.12+\n- `pool` - An object describing which agents to use for the request. If this option is omitted the request will use the global agent (as long as your options allow for it). Otherwise, request will search the pool for your custom agent. If no custom agent is found, a new agent will be created and added to the pool. **Note:** `pool` is used only when the `agent` option is not specified.\n  - A `maxSockets` property can also be provided on the `pool` object to set the max number of sockets for all agents created (ex: `pool: {maxSockets: Infinity}`).\n  - Note that if you are sending multiple requests in a loop and creating\n    multiple new `pool` objects, `maxSockets` will not work as intended.  To\n    work around this, either use [`request.defaults`](#requestdefaultsoptions)\n    with your pool options or create the pool object with the `maxSockets`\n    property outside of the loop.\n- `timeout` - Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a\nserver to send response headers (and start the response body) before aborting\nthe request. Note that if the underlying TCP connection cannot be established,\nthe OS-wide TCP connection timeout will overrule the `timeout` option ([the\ndefault in Linux can be anywhere from 20-120 seconds][linux-timeout]).\n\n[linux-timeout]: http://www.sekuda.com/overriding_the_default_linux_kernel_20_second_tcp_socket_connect_timeout\n\n---\n\n- `localAddress` - Local interface to bind for network connections.\n- `proxy` - An HTTP proxy to be used. Supports proxy Auth with Basic Auth, identical to support for the `url` parameter (by embedding the auth info in the `uri`)\n- `strictSSL` - If `true`, requires SSL certificates be valid. **Note:** to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that CA as an option.\n- `tunnel` - controls the behavior of\n  [HTTP `CONNECT` tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_tunneling)\n  as follows:\n   - `undefined` (default) - `true` if the destination is `https`, `false` otherwise\n   - `true` - always tunnel to the destination by making a `CONNECT` request to\n     the proxy\n   - `false` - request the destination as a `GET` request.\n- `proxyHeaderWhiteList` - A whitelist of headers to send to a\n  tunneling proxy.\n- `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` - A whitelist of headers to send\n  exclusively to a tunneling proxy and not to destination.\n\n---\n\n- `time` - If `true`, the request-response cycle (including all redirects) is timed at millisecond resolution, and the result provided on the response\'s `elapsedTime` property.\n- `har` - A [HAR 1.2 Request Object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request), will be processed from HAR format into options overwriting matching values *(see the [HAR 1.2 section](#support-for-har-1.2) for details)*\n- `callback` - alternatively pass the request\'s callback in the options object\n\nThe callback argument gets 3 arguments:\n\n1. An `error` when applicable (usually from [`http.ClientRequest`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest) object)\n2. An [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object\n3. The third is the `response` body (`String` or `Buffer`, or JSON object if the `json` option is supplied)\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Convenience methods\n\nThere are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.\n\n\n### request.defaults(options)\n\nThis method **returns a wrapper** around the normal request API that defaults\nto whatever options you pass to it.\n\n**Note:** `request.defaults()` **does not** modify the global request API;\ninstead, it **returns a wrapper** that has your default settings applied to it.\n\n**Note:** You can call `.defaults()` on the wrapper that is returned from\n`request.defaults` to add/override defaults that were previously defaulted.\n\nFor example:\n```js\n//requests using baseRequest() will set the \'x-token\' header\nvar baseRequest = request.defaults({\n  headers: {\'x-token\': \'my-token\'}\n})\n\n//requests using specialRequest() will include the \'x-token\' header set in\n//baseRequest and will also include the \'special\' header\nvar specialRequest = baseRequest.defaults({\n  headers: {special: \'special value\'}\n})\n```\n\n### request.put\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "PUT"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.put(url)\n```\n\n### request.patch\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "PATCH"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.patch(url)\n```\n\n### request.post\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "POST"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.post(url)\n```\n\n### request.head\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.head(url)\n```\n\n### request.del / request.delete\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.del(url)\nrequest.delete(url)\n```\n\n### request.get\n\nSame as `request()` (for uniformity).\n\n```js\nrequest.get(url)\n```\n### request.cookie\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie.\n\n```js\nrequest.cookie(\'key1=value1\')\n```\n### request.jar()\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie jar.\n\n```js\nrequest.jar()\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Debugging\n\nThere are at least three ways to debug the operation of `request`:\n\n1. Launch the node process like `NODE_DEBUG=request node script.js`\n   (`lib,request,otherlib` works too).\n\n2. Set `require(\'request\').debug = true` at any time (this does the same thing\n   as #1).\n\n3. Use the [request-debug module](https://github.com/request/request-debug) to\n   view request and response headers and bodies.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Timeouts\n\nMost requests to external servers should have a timeout attached, in case the\nserver is not responding in a timely manner. Without a timeout, your code may\nhave a socket open/consume resources for minutes or more.\n\nThere are two main types of timeouts: **connection timeouts** and **read\ntimeouts**. A connect timeout occurs if the timeout is hit while your client is\nattempting to establish a connection to a remote machine (corresponding to the\n[connect() call][connect] on the socket). A read timeout occurs any time the\nserver is too slow to send back a part of the response.\n\nThese two situations have widely different implications for what went wrong\nwith the request, so it\'s useful to be able to distinguish them. You can detect\ntimeout errors by checking `err.code` for an \'ETIMEDOUT\' value. Further, you\ncan detect whether the timeout was a connection timeout by checking if the\n`err.connect` property is set to `true`.\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://10.255.255.1\', {timeout: 1500}, function(err) {\n    console.log(err.code === \'ETIMEDOUT\');\n    // Set to `true` if the timeout was a connection timeout, `false` or\n    // `undefined` otherwise.\n    console.log(err.connect === true);\n    process.exit(0);\n});\n```\n\n[connect]: http://linux.die.net/man/2/connect\n\n## Examples:\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()\n    ;\n  request(\n    { method: \'PUT\'\n    , uri: \'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\' + rand\n    , multipart:\n      [ { \'content-type\': \'application/json\'\n        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        }\n      , { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ]\n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      if(response.statusCode == 201){\n        console.log(\'document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\'+ rand)\n      } else {\n        console.log(\'error: \'+ response.statusCode)\n        console.log(body)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n```\n\nFor backwards-compatibility, response compression is not supported by default.\nTo accept gzip-compressed responses, set the `gzip` option to `true`.  Note\nthat the body data passed through `request` is automatically decompressed\nwhile the response object is unmodified and will contain compressed data if\nthe server sent a compressed response.\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n  request(\n    { method: \'GET\'\n    , uri: \'http://www.google.com\'\n    , gzip: true\n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      // body is the decompressed response body\n      console.log(\'server encoded the data as: \' + (response.headers[\'content-encoding\'] || \'identity\'))\n      console.log(\'the decoded data is: \' + body)\n    }\n  ).on(\'data\', function(data) {\n    // decompressed data as it is received\n    console.log(\'decoded chunk: \' + data)\n  })\n  .on(\'response\', function(response) {\n    // unmodified http.IncomingMessage object\n    response.on(\'data\', function(data) {\n      // compressed data as it is received\n      console.log(\'received \' + data.length + \' bytes of compressed data\')\n    })\n  })\n```\n\nCookies are disabled by default (else, they would be used in subsequent requests). To enable cookies, set `jar` to `true` (either in `defaults` or `options`).\n\n```js\nvar request = request.defaults({jar: true})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nTo use a custom cookie jar (instead of `request`’s global cookie jar), set `jar` to an instance of `request.jar()` (either in `defaults` or `options`)\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar request = request.defaults({jar:j})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nOR\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar();\nvar cookie = request.cookie(\'key1=value1\');\nvar url = \'http://www.google.com\';\nj.setCookie(cookie, url);\nrequest({url: url, jar: j}, function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nTo use a custom cookie store (such as a\n[`FileCookieStore`](https://github.com/mitsuru/tough-cookie-filestore)\nwhich supports saving to and restoring from JSON files), pass it as a parameter\nto `request.jar()`:\n\n```js\nvar FileCookieStore = require(\'tough-cookie-filestore\');\n// NOTE - currently the \'cookies.json\' file must already exist!\nvar j = request.jar(new FileCookieStore(\'cookies.json\'));\nrequest = request.defaults({ jar : j })\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function() {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nThe cookie store must be a\n[`tough-cookie`](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie)\nstore and it must support synchronous operations; see the\n[`CookieStore` API docs](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie#cookiestore-api)\nfor details.\n\nTo inspect your cookie jar after a request:\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar()\nrequest({url: \'http://www.google.com\', jar: j}, function () {\n  var cookie_string = j.getCookieString(url); // "key1=value1; key2=value2; ..."\n  var cookies = j.getCookies(url);\n  // [{key: \'key1\', value: \'value1\', domain: "www.google.com", ...}, ...]\n})\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n',

It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.\n\n```js\nvar request = require(\'request\');\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function (error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    console.log(body) // Show the HTML for the Google homepage.\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Streaming](#streaming)\n- [Forms](#forms)\n- [HTTP Authentication](#http-authentication)\n- [Custom HTTP Headers](#custom-http-headers)\n- [OAuth Signing](#oauth-signing)\n- [Proxies](#proxies)\n- [Unix Domain Sockets](#unix-domain-sockets)\n- [TLS/SSL Protocol](#tlsssl-protocol)\n- [Support for HAR 1.2](#support-for-har-12)\n- [**All Available Options**](#requestoptions-callback)\n\nRequest also offers [convenience methods](#convenience-methods) like\n`request.defaults` and `request.post`, and there are\nlots of [usage examples](#examples) and several\n[debugging techniques](#debugging).\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Streaming\n\nYou can stream any response to a file stream.\n\n```js\nrequest(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nYou can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types (in this case `application/json`) and use the proper `content-type` in the PUT request (if the headers don’t already provide one).\n\n```js\nfs.createReadStream(\'file.json\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/obj.json\'))\n```\n\nRequest can also `pipe` to itself. When doing so, `content-type` and `content-length` are preserved in the PUT headers.\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://google.com/img.png\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nRequest emits a "response" event when a response is received. The `response` argument will be an instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage).\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .get(\'http://google.com/img.png\')\n  .on(\'response\', function(response) {\n    console.log(response.statusCode) // 200\n    console.log(response.headers[\'content-type\']) // \'image/png\'\n  })\n  .pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nTo easily handle errors when streaming requests, listen to the `error` event before piping:\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n  .on(\'error\', function(err) {\n    console.log(err)\n  })\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nNow let’s get fancy.\n\n```js\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    if (req.method === \'PUT\') {\n      req.pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\'))\n    } else if (req.method === \'GET\' || req.method === \'HEAD\') {\n      request.get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can also `pipe()` from `http.ServerRequest` instances, as well as to `http.ServerResponse` instances. The HTTP method, headers, and entity-body data will be sent. Which means that, if you don\'t really care about security, you can do:\n\n```js\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    var x = request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n    req.pipe(x)\n    x.pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAnd since `pipe()` returns the destination stream in ≥ Node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying. :)\n\n```js\nreq.pipe(request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')).pipe(resp)\n```\n\nAlso, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.\n\n```js\nvar r = request.defaults({\'proxy\':\'http://localproxy.com\'})\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    r.get(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Forms\n\n`request` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads. For `multipart/related` refer to the `multipart` API.\n\n\n#### application/x-www-form-urlencoded (URL-Encoded Forms)\n\nURL-encoded forms are simple.\n\n```js\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', {form:{key:\'value\'}})\n// or\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\').form({key:\'value\'})\n// or\nrequest.post({url:\'http://service.com/upload\', form: {key:\'value\'}}, function(err,httpResponse,body){ /* ... */ })\n```\n\n\n#### multipart/form-data (Multipart Form Uploads)\n\nFor `multipart/form-data` we use the [form-data](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) library by [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge). For the most cases, you can pass your upload form data via the `formData` option.\n\n\n```js\nvar formData = {\n  // Pass a simple key-value pair\n  my_field: \'my_value\',\n  // Pass data via Buffers\n  my_buffer: new Buffer([1, 2, 3]),\n  // Pass data via Streams\n  my_file: fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/unicycle.jpg\'),\n  // Pass multiple values /w an Array\n  attachments: [\n    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/attachment1.jpg\'),\n    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/attachment2.jpg\')\n  ],\n  // Pass optional meta-data with an \'options\' object with style: {value: DATA, options: OPTIONS}\n  // Use case: for some types of streams, you\'ll need to provide "file"-related information manually.\n  // See the `form-data` README for more information about options: https://github.com/form-data/form-data\n  custom_file: {\n    value:  fs.createReadStream(\'/dev/urandom\'),\n    options: {\n      filename: \'topsecret.jpg\',\n      contentType: \'image/jpg\'\n    }\n  }\n};\nrequest.post({url:\'http://service.com/upload\', formData: formData}, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.error(\'upload failed:\', err);\n  }\n  console.log(\'Upload successful!  Server responded with:\', body);\n});\n```\n\nFor advanced cases, you can access the form-data object itself via `r.form()`. This can be modified until the request is fired on the next cycle of the event-loop. (Note that this calling `form()` will clear the currently set form data for that request.)\n\n```js\n// NOTE: Advanced use-case, for normal use see \'formData\' usage above\nvar r = request.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {...})\nvar form = r.form();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my_value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer([1, 2, 3]));\nform.append(\'custom_file\', fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/unicycle.jpg\'), {filename: \'unicycle.jpg\'});\n```\nSee the [form-data README](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) for more information & examples.\n\n\n#### multipart/related\n\nSome variations in different HTTP implementations require a newline/CRLF before, after, or both before and after the boundary of a `multipart/related` request (using the multipart option). This has been observed in the .NET WebAPI version 4.0. You can turn on a boundary preambleCRLF or postamble by passing them as `true` to your request options.\n\n```js\n  request({\n    method: \'PUT\',\n    preambleCRLF: true,\n    postambleCRLF: true,\n    uri: \'http://service.com/upload\',\n    multipart: [\n      {\n        \'content-type\': \'application/json\',\n        body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n      },\n      { body: \'I am an attachment\' },\n      { body: fs.createReadStream(\'image.png\') }\n    ],\n    // alternatively pass an object containing additional options\n    multipart: {\n      chunked: false,\n      data: [\n        {\n          \'content-type\': \'application/json\',\n          body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        },\n        { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  function (error, response, body) {\n    if (error) {\n      return console.error(\'upload failed:\', error);\n    }\n    console.log(\'Upload successful!  Server responded with:\', body);\n  })\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## HTTP Authentication\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\').auth(\'username\', \'password\', false);\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'user\': \'username\',\n    \'pass\': \'password\',\n    \'sendImmediately\': false\n  }\n});\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\').auth(null, null, true, \'bearerToken\');\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'bearer\': \'bearerToken\'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf passed as an option, `auth` should be a hash containing values:\n\n- `user` || `username`\n- `pass` || `password`\n- `sendImmediately` (optional)\n- `bearer` (optional)\n\nThe method form takes parameters\n`auth(username, password, sendImmediately, bearer)`.\n\n`sendImmediately` defaults to `true`, which causes a basic or bearer\nauthentication header to be sent.  If `sendImmediately` is `false`, then\n`request` will retry with a proper authentication header after receiving a\n`401` response from the server (which must contain a `WWW-Authenticate` header\nindicating the required authentication method).\n\nNote that you can also specify basic authentication using the URL itself, as\ndetailed in [RFC 1738](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt).  Simply pass the\n`user:password` before the host with an `@` sign:\n\n```js\nvar username = \'username\',\n    password = \'password\',\n    url = \'http://\' + username + \':\' + password + \'@some.server.com\';\n\nrequest({url: url}, function (error, response, body) {\n   // Do more stuff with \'body\' here\n});\n```\n\nDigest authentication is supported, but it only works with `sendImmediately`\nset to `false`; otherwise `request` will send basic authentication on the\ninitial request, which will probably cause the request to fail.\n\nBearer authentication is supported, and is activated when the `bearer` value is\navailable. The value may be either a `String` or a `Function` returning a\n`String`. Using a function to supply the bearer token is particularly useful if\nused in conjunction with `defaults` to allow a single function to supply the\nlast known token at the time of sending a request, or to compute one on the fly.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Custom HTTP Headers\n\nHTTP Headers, such as `User-Agent`, can be set in the `options` object.\nIn the example below, we call the github API to find out the number\nof stars and forks for the request repository. This requires a\ncustom `User-Agent` header as well as https.\n\n```js\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n  url: \'https://api.github.com/repos/request/request\',\n  headers: {\n    \'User-Agent\': \'request\'\n  }\n};\n\nfunction callback(error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    var info = JSON.parse(body);\n    console.log(info.stargazers_count + " Stars");\n    console.log(info.forks_count + " Forks");\n  }\n}\n\nrequest(options, callback);\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## OAuth Signing\n\n[OAuth version 1.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849) is supported.  The\ndefault signing algorithm is\n[HMAC-SHA1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.2):\n\n```js\n// OAuth1.0 - 3-legged server side flow (Twitter example)\n// step 1\nvar qs = require(\'querystring\')\n  , oauth =\n    { callback: \'http://mysite.com/callback/\'\n    , consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n    , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n    }\n  , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token\'\n  ;\nrequest.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n  // Ideally, you would take the body in the response\n  // and construct a URL that a user clicks on (like a sign in button).\n  // The verifier is only available in the response after a user has\n  // verified with twitter that they are authorizing your app.\n\n  // step 2\n  var req_data = qs.parse(body)\n  var uri = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate\'\n    + \'?\' + qs.stringify({oauth_token: req_data.oauth_token})\n  // redirect the user to the authorize uri\n\n  // step 3\n  // after the user is redirected back to your server\n  var auth_data = qs.parse(body)\n    , oauth =\n      { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n      , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n      , token: auth_data.oauth_token\n      , token_secret: req_data.oauth_token_secret\n      , verifier: auth_data.oauth_verifier\n      }\n    , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token\'\n    ;\n  request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n    // ready to make signed requests on behalf of the user\n    var perm_data = qs.parse(body)\n      , oauth =\n        { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n        , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n        , token: perm_data.oauth_token\n        , token_secret: perm_data.oauth_token_secret\n        }\n      , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/show.json\'\n      , qs =\n        { screen_name: perm_data.screen_name\n        , user_id: perm_data.user_id\n        }\n      ;\n    request.get({url:url, oauth:oauth, qs:qs, json:true}, function (e, r, user) {\n      console.log(user)\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\nFor [RSA-SHA1 signing](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.3), make\nthe following changes to the OAuth options object:\n* Pass `signature_method : \'RSA-SHA1\'`\n* Instead of `consumer_secret`, specify a `private_key` string in\n  [PEM format](http://how2ssl.com/articles/working_with_pem_files/)\n\nFor [PLAINTEXT signing](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#anchor22), make\nthe following changes to the OAuth options object:\n* Pass `signature_method : \'PLAINTEXT\'`\n\nTo send OAuth parameters via query params or in a post body as described in The\n[Consumer Request Parameters](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#consumer_req_param)\nsection of the oauth1 spec:\n* Pass `transport_method : \'query\'` or `transport_method : \'body\'` in the OAuth\n  options object.\n* `transport_method` defaults to `\'header\'`\n\nTo use [Request Body Hash](https://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/spec/ext/body_hash/1.0/oauth-bodyhash.html) you can either\n* Manually generate the body hash and pass it as a string `body_hash: \'...\'`\n* Automatically generate the body hash by passing `body_hash: true`\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Proxies\n\nIf you specify a `proxy` option, then the request (and any subsequent\nredirects) will be sent via a connection to the proxy server.\n\nIf your endpoint is an `https` url, and you are using a proxy, then\nrequest will send a `CONNECT` request to the proxy server *first*, and\nthen use the supplied connection to connect to the endpoint.\n\nThat is, first it will make a request like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 CONNECT endpoint-server.com:80\nHost: proxy-server.com\nUser-Agent: whatever user agent you specify\n```\n\nand then the proxy server make a TCP connection to `endpoint-server`\non port `80`, and return a response that looks like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n```\n\nAt this point, the connection is left open, and the client is\ncommunicating directly with the `endpoint-server.com` machine.\n\nSee [the wikipedia page on HTTP Tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel)\nfor more information.\n\nBy default, when proxying `http` traffic, request will simply make a\nstandard proxied `http` request.  This is done by making the `url`\nsection of the initial line of the request a fully qualified url to\nthe endpoint.\n\nFor example, it will make a single request that looks like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 GET http://endpoint-server.com/some-url\nHost: proxy-server.com\nOther-Headers: all go here\n\nrequest body or whatever\n```\n\nBecause a pure "http over http" tunnel offers no additional security\nor other features, it is generally simpler to go with a\nstraightforward HTTP proxy in this case.  However, if you would like\nto force a tunneling proxy, you may set the `tunnel` option to `true`.\n\nYou can also make a standard proxied `http` request by explicitly setting\n`tunnel : false`, but **note that this will allow the proxy to see the traffic\nto/from the destination server**.\n\nIf you are using a tunneling proxy, you may set the\n`proxyHeaderWhiteList` to share certain headers with the proxy.\n\nYou can also set the `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` to share certain\nheaders only with the proxy and not with destination host.\n\nBy default, this set is:\n\n```\naccept\naccept-charset\naccept-encoding\naccept-language\naccept-ranges\ncache-control\ncontent-encoding\ncontent-language\ncontent-length\ncontent-location\ncontent-md5\ncontent-range\ncontent-type\nconnection\ndate\nexpect\nmax-forwards\npragma\nproxy-authorization\nreferer\nte\ntransfer-encoding\nuser-agent\nvia\n```\n\nNote that, when using a tunneling proxy, the `proxy-authorization`\nheader and any headers from custom `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` are\n*never* sent to the endpoint server, but only to the proxy server.\n\n\n### Controlling proxy behaviour using environment variables\n\nThe following environment variables are respected by `request`:\n\n * `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy`\n * `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`\n * `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy`\n\nWhen `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy` are set, they will be used to proxy non-SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option present. Similarly, `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy` will be respected for SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option. It is valid to define a proxy in one of the environment variables, but then override it for a specific request, using the `proxy` configuration option. Furthermore, the `proxy` configuration option can be explicitly set to false / null to opt out of proxying altogether for that request.\n\n`request` is also aware of the `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` environment variables. These variables provide a granular way to opt out of proxying, on a per-host basis. It should contain a comma separated list of hosts to opt out of proxying. It is also possible to opt of proxying when a particular destination port is used. Finally, the variable may be set to `*` to opt out of the implicit proxy configuration of the other environment variables.\n\nHere\'s some examples of valid `no_proxy` values:\n\n * `google.com` - don\'t proxy HTTP/HTTPS requests to Google.\n * `google.com:443` - don\'t proxy HTTPS requests to Google, but *do* proxy HTTP requests to Google.\n * `google.com:443, yahoo.com:80` - don\'t proxy HTTPS requests to Google, and don\'t proxy HTTP requests to Yahoo!\n * `*` - ignore `https_proxy`/`http_proxy` environment variables altogether.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## UNIX Domain Sockets\n\n`request` supports making requests to [UNIX Domain Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket). To make one, use the following URL scheme:\n\n```js\n/* Pattern */ \'http://unix:SOCKET:PATH\'\n/* Example */ request.get(\'http://unix:/absolute/path/to/unix.socket:/request/path\')\n```\n\nNote: The `SOCKET` path is assumed to be absolute to the root of the host file system.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## TLS/SSL Protocol\n\nTLS/SSL Protocol options, such as `cert`, `key` and `passphrase`, can be\nset directly in `options` object, in the `agentOptions` property of the `options` object, or even in `https.globalAgent.options`. Keep in mind that, although `agentOptions` allows for a slightly wider range of configurations, the recommended way is via `options` object directly, as using `agentOptions` or `https.globalAgent.options` would not be applied in the same way in proxied environments (as data travels through a TLS connection instead of an http/https agent).\n\n```js\nvar fs = require(\'fs\')\n    , path = require(\'path\')\n    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.crt\')\n    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.key\')\n    , caFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/ca.cert.pem\')\n    , request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),\n    key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),\n    passphrase: \'password\',\n    ca: fs.readFileSync(caFile)\n};\n\nrequest.get(options);\n```\n\n### Using `options.agentOptions`\n\nIn the example below, we call an API requires client side SSL certificate\n(in PEM format) with passphrase protected private key (in PEM format) and disable the SSLv3 protocol:\n\n```js\nvar fs = require(\'fs\')\n    , path = require(\'path\')\n    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.crt\')\n    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.key\')\n    , request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),\n        key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),\n        // Or use `pfx` property replacing `cert` and `key` when using private key, certificate and CA certs in PFX or PKCS12 format:\n        // pfx: fs.readFileSync(pfxFilePath),\n        passphrase: \'password\',\n        securityOptions: \'SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3\'\n    }\n};\n\nrequest.get(options);\n```\n\nIt is able to force using SSLv3 only by specifying `secureProtocol`:\n\n```js\nrequest.get({\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        secureProtocol: \'SSLv3_method\'\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIt is possible to accept other certificates than those signed by generally allowed Certificate Authorities (CAs).\nThis can be useful, for example,  when using self-signed certificates.\nTo require a different root certificate, you can specify the signing CA by adding the contents of the CA\'s certificate file to the `agentOptions`.\nThe certificate the domain presents must be signed by the root certificate specified:\n\n```js\nrequest.get({\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        ca: fs.readFileSync(\'ca.cert.pem\')\n    }\n});\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Support for HAR 1.2\n\nThe `options.har` property will override the values: `url`, `method`, `qs`, `headers`, `form`, `formData`, `body`, `json`, as well as construct multipart data and read files from disk when `request.postData.params[].fileName` is present without a matching `value`.\n\na validation step will check if the HAR Request format matches the latest spec (v1.2) and will skip parsing if not matching.\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n  request({\n    // will be ignored\n    method: \'GET\',\n    uri: \'http://www.google.com\',\n\n    // HTTP Archive Request Object\n    har: {\n      url: \'http://www.mockbin.com/har\',\n      method: \'POST\',\n      headers: [\n        {\n          name: \'content-type\',\n          value: \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n        }\n      ],\n      postData: {\n        mimeType: \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\',\n        params: [\n          {\n            name: \'foo\',\n            value: \'bar\'\n          },\n          {\n            name: \'hello\',\n            value: \'world\'\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  })\n\n  // a POST request will be sent to http://www.mockbin.com\n  // with body an application/x-www-form-urlencoded body:\n  // foo=bar&hello=world\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## request(options, callback)\n\nThe first argument can be either a `url` or an `options` object. The only required option is `uri`; all others are optional.\n\n- `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from `url.parse()`\n- `baseUrl` - fully qualified uri string used as the base url. Most useful with `request.defaults`, for example when you want to do many requests to the same domain.  If `baseUrl` is `https://example.com/api/`, then requesting `/end/point?test=true` will fetch `https://example.com/api/end/point?test=true`. When `baseUrl` is given, `uri` must also be a string.\n- `method` - http method (default: `"GET"`)\n- `headers` - http headers (default: `{}`)\n\n---\n\n- `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the `uri`\n- `qsParseOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.parse](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#parsing-objects) method. Alternatively pass options to the [querystring.parse](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_parse_str_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:\';\', eq:\':\', options:{}}`\n- `qsStringifyOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.stringify](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#stringifying) method. Alternatively pass options to the  [querystring.stringify](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_stringify_obj_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:\';\', eq:\':\', options:{}}`. For example, to change the way arrays are converted to query strings using the `qs` module pass the `arrayFormat` option with one of `indices|brackets|repeat`\n- `useQuerystring` - If true, use `querystring` to stringify and parse\n  querystrings, otherwise use `qs` (default: `false`).  Set this option to\n  `true` if you need arrays to be serialized as `foo=bar&foo=baz` instead of the\n  default `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=baz`.\n\n---\n\n- `body` - entity body for PATCH, POST and PUT requests. Must be a `Buffer`, `String` or `ReadStream`. If `json` is `true`, then `body` must be a JSON-serializable object.\n- `form` - when passed an object or a querystring, this sets `body` to a querystring representation of value, and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header. When passed no options, a `FormData` instance is returned (and is piped to request). See "Forms" section above.\n- `formData` - Data to pass for a `multipart/form-data` request. See\n  [Forms](#forms) section above.\n- `multipart` - array of objects which contain their own headers and `body`\n  attributes. Sends a `multipart/related` request. See [Forms](#forms) section\n  above.\n  - Alternatively you can pass in an object `{chunked: false, data: []}` where\n    `chunked` is used to specify whether the request is sent in\n    [chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding)\n    In non-chunked requests, data items with body streams are not allowed.\n- `preambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF before the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.\n- `postambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF at the end of the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.\n- `json` - sets `body` to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header.  Additionally, parses the response body as JSON.\n- `jsonReviver` - a [reviver function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) that will be passed to `JSON.parse()` when parsing a JSON response body.\n- `jsonReplacer` - a [replacer function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) that will be passed to `JSON.stringify()` when stringifying a JSON request body.\n\n---\n\n- `auth` - A hash containing values `user` || `username`, `pass` || `password`, and `sendImmediately` (optional).  See documentation above.\n- `oauth` - Options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing. See documentation above.\n- `hawk` - Options for [Hawk signing](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk). The `credentials` key must contain the necessary signing info, [see hawk docs for details](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk#usage-example).\n- `aws` - `object` containing AWS signing information. Should have the properties `key`, `secret`. Also requires the property `bucket`, unless you’re specifying your `bucket` as part of the path, or the request doesn’t use a bucket (i.e. GET Services). If you want to use AWS sign version 4 use the parameter `sign_version` with value `4` otherwise the default is version 2. **Note:** you need to `npm install aws4` first.\n- `httpSignature` - Options for the [HTTP Signature Scheme](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md) using [Joyent\'s library](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature). The `keyId` and `key` properties must be specified. See the docs for other options.\n\n---\n\n- `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `true`). This property can also be implemented as function which gets `response` object as a single argument and should return `true` if redirects should continue or `false` otherwise.\n- `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `false`)\n- `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow (default: `10`)\n- `removeRefererHeader` - removes the referer header when a redirect happens (default: `false`). **Note:** if true, referer header set in the initial request is preserved during redirect chain.\n\n---\n\n- `encoding` - Encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If `null`, the `body` is returned as a `Buffer`. Anything else **(including the default value of `undefined`)** will be passed as the [encoding](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) parameter to `toString()` (meaning this is effectively `utf8` by default). (**Note:** if you expect binary data, you should set `encoding: null`.)\n- `gzip` - If `true`, add an `Accept-Encoding` header to request compressed content encodings from the server (if not already present) and decode supported content encodings in the response.  **Note:** Automatic decoding of the response content is performed on the body data returned through `request` (both through the `request` stream and passed to the callback function) but is not performed on the `response` stream (available from the `response` event) which is the unmodified `http.IncomingMessage` object which may contain compressed data. See example below.\n- `jar` - If `true`, remember cookies for future use (or define your custom cookie jar; see examples section)\n\n---\n\n- `agent` - `http(s).Agent` instance to use\n- `agentClass` - alternatively specify your agent\'s class name\n- `agentOptions` - and pass its options. **Note:** for HTTPS see [tls API doc for TLS/SSL options](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) and the [documentation above](#using-optionsagentoptions).\n- `forever` - set to `true` to use the [forever-agent](https://github.com/request/forever-agent) **Note:** Defaults to `http(s).Agent({keepAlive:true})` in node 0.12+\n- `pool` - An object describing which agents to use for the request. If this option is omitted the request will use the global agent (as long as your options allow for it). Otherwise, request will search the pool for your custom agent. If no custom agent is found, a new agent will be created and added to the pool. **Note:** `pool` is used only when the `agent` option is not specified.\n  - A `maxSockets` property can also be provided on the `pool` object to set the max number of sockets for all agents created (ex: `pool: {maxSockets: Infinity}`).\n  - Note that if you are sending multiple requests in a loop and creating\n    multiple new `pool` objects, `maxSockets` will not work as intended.  To\n    work around this, either use [`request.defaults`](#requestdefaultsoptions)\n    with your pool options or create the pool object with the `maxSockets`\n    property outside of the loop.\n- `timeout` - Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a\nserver to send response headers (and start the response body) before aborting\nthe request. Note that if the underlying TCP connection cannot be established,\nthe OS-wide TCP connection timeout will overrule the `timeout` option ([the\ndefault in Linux can be anywhere from 20-120 seconds][linux-timeout]).\n\n[linux-timeout]: http://www.sekuda.com/overriding_the_default_linux_kernel_20_second_tcp_socket_connect_timeout\n\n---\n\n- `localAddress` - Local interface to bind for network connections.\n- `proxy` - An HTTP proxy to be used. Supports proxy Auth with Basic Auth, identical to support for the `url` parameter (by embedding the auth info in the `uri`)\n- `strictSSL` - If `true`, requires SSL certificates be valid. **Note:** to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that CA as an option.\n- `tunnel` - controls the behavior of\n  [HTTP `CONNECT` tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_tunneling)\n  as follows:\n   - `undefined` (default) - `true` if the destination is `https`, `false` otherwise\n   - `true` - always tunnel to the destination by making a `CONNECT` request to\n     the proxy\n   - `false` - request the destination as a `GET` request.\n- `proxyHeaderWhiteList` - A whitelist of headers to send to a\n  tunneling proxy.\n- `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` - A whitelist of headers to send\n  exclusively to a tunneling proxy and not to destination.\n\n---\n\n- `time` - If `true`, the request-response cycle (including all redirects) is timed at millisecond resolution, and the result provided on the response\'s `elapsedTime` property.\n- `har` - A [HAR 1.2 Request Object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request), will be processed from HAR format into options overwriting matching values *(see the [HAR 1.2 section](#support-for-har-1.2) for details)*\n- `callback` - alternatively pass the request\'s callback in the options object\n\nThe callback argument gets 3 arguments:\n\n1. An `error` when applicable (usually from [`http.ClientRequest`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest) object)\n2. An [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object\n3. The third is the `response` body (`String` or `Buffer`, or JSON object if the `json` option is supplied)\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Convenience methods\n\nThere are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.\n\n\n### request.defaults(options)\n\nThis method **returns a wrapper** around the normal request API that defaults\nto whatever options you pass to it.\n\n**Note:** `request.defaults()` **does not** modify the global request API;\ninstead, it **returns a wrapper** that has your default settings applied to it.\n\n**Note:** You can call `.defaults()` on the wrapper that is returned from\n`request.defaults` to add/override defaults that were previously defaulted.\n\nFor example:\n```js\n//requests using baseRequest() will set the \'x-token\' header\nvar baseRequest = request.defaults({\n  headers: {\'x-token\': \'my-token\'}\n})\n\n//requests using specialRequest() will include the \'x-token\' header set in\n//baseRequest and will also include the \'special\' header\nvar specialRequest = baseRequest.defaults({\n  headers: {special: \'special value\'}\n})\n```\n\n### request.put\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "PUT"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.put(url)\n```\n\n### request.patch\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "PATCH"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.patch(url)\n```\n\n### request.post\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "POST"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.post(url)\n```\n\n### request.head\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.head(url)\n```\n\n### request.del / request.delete\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.del(url)\nrequest.delete(url)\n```\n\n### request.get\n\nSame as `request()` (for uniformity).\n\n```js\nrequest.get(url)\n```\n### request.cookie\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie.\n\n```js\nrequest.cookie(\'key1=value1\')\n```\n### request.jar()\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie jar.\n\n```js\nrequest.jar()\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Debugging\n\nThere are at least three ways to debug the operation of `request`:\n\n1. Launch the node process like `NODE_DEBUG=request node script.js`\n   (`lib,request,otherlib` works too).\n\n2. Set `require(\'request\').debug = true` at any time (this does the same thing\n   as #1).\n\n3. Use the [request-debug module](https://github.com/request/request-debug) to\n   view request and response headers and bodies.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Timeouts\n\nMost requests to external servers should have a timeout attached, in case the\nserver is not responding in a timely manner. Without a timeout, your code may\nhave a socket open/consume resources for minutes or more.\n\nThere are two main types of timeouts: **connection timeouts** and **read\ntimeouts**. A connect timeout occurs if the timeout is hit while your client is\nattempting to establish a connection to a remote machine (corresponding to the\n[connect() call][connect] on the socket). A read timeout occurs any time the\nserver is too slow to send back a part of the response.\n\nThese two situations have widely different implications for what went wrong\nwith the request, so it\'s useful to be able to distinguish them. You can detect\ntimeout errors by checking `err.code` for an \'ETIMEDOUT\' value. Further, you\ncan detect whether the timeout was a connection timeout by checking if the\n`err.connect` property is set to `true`.\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://10.255.255.1\', {timeout: 1500}, function(err) {\n    console.log(err.code === \'ETIMEDOUT\');\n    // Set to `true` if the timeout was a connection timeout, `false` or\n    // `undefined` otherwise.\n    console.log(err.connect === true);\n    process.exit(0);\n});\n```\n\n[connect]: http://linux.die.net/man/2/connect\n\n## Examples:\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()\n    ;\n  request(\n    { method: \'PUT\'\n    , uri: \'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\' + rand\n    , multipart:\n      [ { \'content-type\': \'application/json\'\n        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        }\n      , { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ]\n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      if(response.statusCode == 201){\n        console.log(\'document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\'+ rand)\n      } else {\n        console.log(\'error: \'+ response.statusCode)\n        console.log(body)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n```\n\nFor backwards-compatibility, response compression is not supported by default.\nTo accept gzip-compressed responses, set the `gzip` option to `true`.  Note\nthat the body data passed through `request` is automatically decompressed\nwhile the response object is unmodified and will contain compressed data if\nthe server sent a compressed response.\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n  request(\n    { method: \'GET\'\n    , uri: \'http://www.google.com\'\n    , gzip: true\n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      // body is the decompressed response body\n      console.log(\'server encoded the data as: \' + (response.headers[\'content-encoding\'] || \'identity\'))\n      console.log(\'the decoded data is: \' + body)\n    }\n  ).on(\'data\', function(data) {\n    // decompressed data as it is received\n    console.log(\'decoded chunk: \' + data)\n  })\n  .on(\'response\', function(response) {\n    // unmodified http.IncomingMessage object\n    response.on(\'data\', function(data) {\n      // compressed data as it is received\n      console.log(\'received \' + data.length + \' bytes of compressed data\')\n    })\n  })\n```\n\nCookies are disabled by default (else, they would be used in subsequent requests). To enable cookies, set `jar` to `true` (either in `defaults` or `options`).\n\n```js\nvar request = request.defaults({jar: true})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nTo use a custom cookie jar (instead of `request`’s global cookie jar), set `jar` to an instance of `request.jar()` (either in `defaults` or `options`)\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar request = request.defaults({jar:j})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nOR\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar();\nvar cookie = request.cookie(\'key1=value1\');\nvar url = \'http://www.google.com\';\nj.setCookie(cookie, url);\nrequest({url: url, jar: j}, function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nTo use a custom cookie store (such as a\n[`FileCookieStore`](https://github.com/mitsuru/tough-cookie-filestore)\nwhich supports saving to and restoring from JSON files), pass it as a parameter\nto `request.jar()`:\n\n```js\nvar FileCookieStore = require(\'tough-cookie-filestore\');\n// NOTE - currently the \'cookies.json\' file must already exist!\nvar j = request.jar(new FileCookieStore(\'cookies.json\'));\nrequest = request.defaults({ jar : j })\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function() {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nThe cookie store must be a\n[`tough-cookie`](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie)\nstore and it must support synchronous operations; see the\n[`CookieStore` API docs](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie#cookiestore-api)\nfor details.\n\nTo inspect your cookie jar after a request:\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar()\nrequest({url: \'http://www.google.com\', jar: j}, function () {\n  var cookie_string = j.getCookieString(url); // "key1=value1; key2=value2; ..."\n  var cookies = j.getCookies(url);\n  // [{key: \'key1\', value: \'value1\', domain: "www.google.com", ...}, ...]\n})\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n',

187744 silly resolved     readme: '# minimatch\n\nA minimal matching utility.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n\nThis is the matching library used internally by npm.\n\nIt works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp`\nobjects.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar minimatch = require("minimatch")\n\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.foo") // true!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.bar") // false!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.+(bar|foo)", { debug: true }) // true, and noisy!\n```\n\n## Features\n\nSupports these glob features:\n\n* Brace Expansion\n* Extended glob matching\n* "Globstar" `**` matching\n\nSee:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash`\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n\n## Minimatch Class\n\nCreate a minimatch object by instantiating the `minimatch.Minimatch` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Minimatch = require("minimatch").Minimatch\nvar mm = new Minimatch(pattern, options)\n```\n\n### Properties\n\n* `pattern` The original pattern the minimatch object represents.\n* `options` The options supplied to the constructor.\n* `set` A 2-dimensional array of regexp or string expressions.\n  Each row in the\n  array corresponds to a brace-expanded pattern.  Each item in the row\n  corresponds to a single path-part.  For example, the pattern\n  `{a,b/c}/d` would expand to a set of patterns like:\n\n        [ [ a, d ]\n        , [ b, c, d ] ]\n\n    If a portion of the pattern doesn\'t have any "magic" in it\n    (that is, it\'s something like `"foo"` rather than `fo*o?`), then it\n    will be left as a string rather than converted to a regular\n    expression.\n\n* `regexp` Created by the `makeRe` method.  A single regular expression\n  expressing the entire pattern.  This is useful in cases where you wish\n  to use the pattern somewhat like `fnmatch(3)` with `FNM_PATH` enabled.\n* `negate` True if the pattern is negated.\n* `comment` True if the pattern is a comment.\n* `empty` True if the pattern is `""`.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `makeRe` Generate the `regexp` member if necessary, and return it.\n  Will return `false` if the pattern is invalid.\n* `match(fname)` Return true if the filename matches the pattern, or\n  false otherwise.\n* `matchOne(fileArray, patternArray, partial)` Take a `/`-split\n  filename, and match it against a single row in the `regExpSet`.  This\n  method is mainly for internal use, but is exposed so that it can be\n  used by a glob-walker that needs to avoid excessive filesystem calls.\n\nAll other methods are internal, and will be called as necessary.\n\n### minimatch(path, pattern, options)\n\nMain export.  Tests a path against the pattern using the options.\n\n```javascript\nvar isJS = minimatch(file, "*.js", { matchBase: true })\n```\n\n### minimatch.filter(pattern, options)\n\nReturns a function that tests its\nsupplied argument, suitable for use with `Array.filter`.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = fileList.filter(minimatch.filter("*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.match(list, pattern, options)\n\nMatch against the list of\nfiles, in the style of fnmatch or glob.  If nothing is matched, and\noptions.nonull is set, then return a list containing the pattern itself.\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = minimatch.match(fileList, "*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.makeRe(pattern, options)\n\nMake a regular expression object from the pattern.\n\n## Options\n\nAll options are `false` by default.\n\n### debug\n\nDump a ton of stuff to stderr.\n\n### nobrace\n\nDo not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.\n\n### noglobstar\n\nDisable `**` matching against multiple folder names.\n\n### dot\n\nAllow patterns to match filenames starting with a period, even if\nthe pattern does not explicitly have a period in that spot.\n\nNote that by default, `a/**/b` will **not** match `a/.d/b`, unless `dot`\nis set.\n\n### noext\n\nDisable "extglob" style patterns like `+(a|b)`.\n\n### nocase\n\nPerform a case-insensitive match.\n\n### nonull\n\nWhen a match is not found by `minimatch.match`, return a list containing\nthe pattern itself if this option is set.  When not set, an empty list\nis returned if there are no matches.\n\n### matchBase\n\nIf set, then patterns without slashes will be matched\nagainst the basename of the path if it contains slashes.  For example,\n`a?b` would match the path `/xyz/123/acb`, but not `/xyz/acb/123`.\n\n### nocomment\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating `#` at the start of a pattern as a\ncomment.\n\n### nonegate\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating a leading `!` character as negation.\n\n### flipNegate\n\nReturns from negate expressions the same as if they were not negated.\n(Ie, true on a hit, false on a miss.)\n\n\n## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations\n\nWhile strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile\ngoal, some discrepancies exist between minimatch and other\nimplementations, and are intentional.\n\nIf the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the\n`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`\ncharacters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the\npattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`\ncharacters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple\ntimes.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and\nwill not match anything.  Use `\\#` to match a literal `#` at the\nstart of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.\n\nThe double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the\n`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob\nand bash 4.1, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only\nthing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but\n`a/**b` will not.\n\nIf an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,\nthen minimatch.match returns the pattern as-provided, rather than\ninterpreting the character escapes.  For example,\n`minimatch.match([], "\\\\*a\\\\?")` will return `"\\\\*a\\\\?"` rather than\n`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except\nthat it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\n\nIf brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any\nother interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like\n`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded\n**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are\nchecked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.\n',

187750 silly resolved     readme: '# minimatch\n\nA minimal matching utility.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n\nThis is the matching library used internally by npm.\n\nIt works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp`\nobjects.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar minimatch = require("minimatch")\n\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.foo") // true!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.bar") // false!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.+(bar|foo)", { debug: true }) // true, and noisy!\n```\n\n## Features\n\nSupports these glob features:\n\n* Brace Expansion\n* Extended glob matching\n* "Globstar" `**` matching\n\nSee:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash`\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n\n## Minimatch Class\n\nCreate a minimatch object by instantiating the `minimatch.Minimatch` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Minimatch = require("minimatch").Minimatch\nvar mm = new Minimatch(pattern, options)\n```\n\n### Properties\n\n* `pattern` The original pattern the minimatch object represents.\n* `options` The options supplied to the constructor.\n* `set` A 2-dimensional array of regexp or string expressions.\n  Each row in the\n  array corresponds to a brace-expanded pattern.  Each item in the row\n  corresponds to a single path-part.  For example, the pattern\n  `{a,b/c}/d` would expand to a set of patterns like:\n\n        [ [ a, d ]\n        , [ b, c, d ] ]\n\n    If a portion of the pattern doesn\'t have any "magic" in it\n    (that is, it\'s something like `"foo"` rather than `fo*o?`), then it\n    will be left as a string rather than converted to a regular\n    expression.\n\n* `regexp` Created by the `makeRe` method.  A single regular expression\n  expressing the entire pattern.  This is useful in cases where you wish\n  to use the pattern somewhat like `fnmatch(3)` with `FNM_PATH` enabled.\n* `negate` True if the pattern is negated.\n* `comment` True if the pattern is a comment.\n* `empty` True if the pattern is `""`.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `makeRe` Generate the `regexp` member if necessary, and return it.\n  Will return `false` if the pattern is invalid.\n* `match(fname)` Return true if the filename matches the pattern, or\n  false otherwise.\n* `matchOne(fileArray, patternArray, partial)` Take a `/`-split\n  filename, and match it against a single row in the `regExpSet`.  This\n  method is mainly for internal use, but is exposed so that it can be\n  used by a glob-walker that needs to avoid excessive filesystem calls.\n\nAll other methods are internal, and will be called as necessary.\n\n### minimatch(path, pattern, options)\n\nMain export.  Tests a path against the pattern using the options.\n\n```javascript\nvar isJS = minimatch(file, "*.js", { matchBase: true })\n```\n\n### minimatch.filter(pattern, options)\n\nReturns a function that tests its\nsupplied argument, suitable for use with `Array.filter`.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = fileList.filter(minimatch.filter("*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.match(list, pattern, options)\n\nMatch against the list of\nfiles, in the style of fnmatch or glob.  If nothing is matched, and\noptions.nonull is set, then return a list containing the pattern itself.\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = minimatch.match(fileList, "*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.makeRe(pattern, options)\n\nMake a regular expression object from the pattern.\n\n## Options\n\nAll options are `false` by default.\n\n### debug\n\nDump a ton of stuff to stderr.\n\n### nobrace\n\nDo not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.\n\n### noglobstar\n\nDisable `**` matching against multiple folder names.\n\n### dot\n\nAllow patterns to match filenames starting with a period, even if\nthe pattern does not explicitly have a period in that spot.\n\nNote that by default, `a/**/b` will **not** match `a/.d/b`, unless `dot`\nis set.\n\n### noext\n\nDisable "extglob" style patterns like `+(a|b)`.\n\n### nocase\n\nPerform a case-insensitive match.\n\n### nonull\n\nWhen a match is not found by `minimatch.match`, return a list containing\nthe pattern itself if this option is set.  When not set, an empty list\nis returned if there are no matches.\n\n### matchBase\n\nIf set, then patterns without slashes will be matched\nagainst the basename of the path if it contains slashes.  For example,\n`a?b` would match the path `/xyz/123/acb`, but not `/xyz/acb/123`.\n\n### nocomment\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating `#` at the start of a pattern as a\ncomment.\n\n### nonegate\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating a leading `!` character as negation.\n\n### flipNegate\n\nReturns from negate expressions the same as if they were not negated.\n(Ie, true on a hit, false on a miss.)\n\n\n## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations\n\nWhile strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile\ngoal, some discrepancies exist between minimatch and other\nimplementations, and are intentional.\n\nIf the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the\n`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`\ncharacters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the\npattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`\ncharacters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple\ntimes.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and\nwill not match anything.  Use `\\#` to match a literal `#` at the\nstart of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.\n\nThe double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the\n`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob\nand bash 4.1, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only\nthing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but\n`a/**b` will not.\n\nIf an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,\nthen minimatch.match returns the pattern as-provided, rather than\ninterpreting the character escapes.  For example,\n`minimatch.match([], "\\\\*a\\\\?")` will return `"\\\\*a\\\\?"` rather than\n`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except\nthat it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\n\nIf brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any\nother interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like\n`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded\n**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are\nchecked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.\n',

Each item in the row\n  corresponds to a single path-part.  For example, the pattern\n  `{a,b/c}/d` would expand to a set of patterns like:\n\n        [ [ a, d ]\n        , [ b, c, d ] ]\n\n    If a portion of the pattern doesn\'t have any "magic" in it\n    (that is, it\'s something like `"foo"` rather than `fo*o?`), then it\n    will be left as a string rather than converted to a regular\n    expression.\n\n* `regexp` Created by the `makeRe` method.  A single regular expression\n  expressing the entire pattern.  This is useful in cases where you wish\n  to use the pattern somewhat like `fnmatch(3)` with `FNM_PATH` enabled.\n* `negate` True if the pattern is negated.\n* `comment` True if the pattern is a comment.\n* `empty` True if the pattern is `""`.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `makeRe` Generate the `regexp` member if necessary, and return it.\n  Will return `false` if the pattern is invalid.\n* `match(fname)` Return true if the filename matches the pattern, or\n  false otherwise.\n* `matchOne(fileArray, patternArray, partial)` Take a `/`-split\n  filename, and match it against a single row in the `regExpSet`.  This\n  method is mainly for internal use, but is exposed so that it can be\n  used by a glob-walker that needs to avoid excessive filesystem calls.\n\nAll other methods are internal, and will be called as necessary.\n\n### minimatch(path, pattern, options)\n\nMain export.  Tests a path against the pattern using the options.\n\n```javascript\nvar isJS = minimatch(file, "*.js", { matchBase: true })\n```\n\n### minimatch.filter(pattern, options)\n\nReturns a function that tests its\nsupplied argument, suitable for use with `Array.filter`.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = fileList.filter(minimatch.filter("*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.match(list, pattern, options)\n\nMatch against the list of\nfiles, in the style of fnmatch or glob.  If nothing is matched, and\noptions.nonull is set, then return a list containing the pattern itself.\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = minimatch.match(fileList, "*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.makeRe(pattern, options)\n\nMake a regular expression object from the pattern.\n\n## Options\n\nAll options are `false` by default.\n\n### debug\n\nDump a ton of stuff to stderr.\n\n### nobrace\n\nDo not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.\n\n### noglobstar\n\nDisable `**` matching against multiple folder names.\n\n### dot\n\nAllow patterns to match filenames starting with a period, even if\nthe pattern does not explicitly have a period in that spot.\n\nNote that by default, `a/**/b` will **not** match `a/.d/b`, unless `dot`\nis set.\n\n### noext\n\nDisable "extglob" style patterns like `+(a|b)`.\n\n### nocase\n\nPerform a case-insensitive match.\n\n### nonull\n\nWhen a match is not found by `minimatch.match`, return a list containing\nthe pattern itself if this option is set.  When not set, an empty list\nis returned if there are no matches.\n\n### matchBase\n\nIf set, then patterns without slashes will be matched\nagainst the basename of the path if it contains slashes.  For example,\n`a?b` would match the path `/xyz/123/acb`, but not `/xyz/acb/123`.\n\n### nocomment\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating `#` at the start of a pattern as a\ncomment.\n\n### nonegate\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating a leading `!` character as negation.\n\n### flipNegate\n\nReturns from negate expressions the same as if they were not negated.\n(Ie, true on a hit, false on a miss.)\n\n\n## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations\n\nWhile strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile\ngoal, some discrepancies exist between minimatch and other\nimplementations, and are intentional.\n\nIf the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the\n`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`\ncharacters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the\npattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`\ncharacters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple\ntimes.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and\nwill not match anything.  Use `\\#` to match a literal `#` at the\nstart of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.\n\nThe double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the\n`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob\nand bash 4.1, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only\nthing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but\n`a/**b` will not.\n\nIf an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,\nthen minimatch.match returns the pattern as-provided, rather than\ninterpreting the character escapes.  For example,\n`minimatch.match([], "\\\\*a\\\\?")` will return `"\\\\*a\\\\?"` rather than\n`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except\nthat it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\n\nIf brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any\nother interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like\n`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded\n**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are\nchecked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.\n',

187768 silly resolved     readme: '# minimatch\n\nA minimal matching utility.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n\nThis is the matching library used internally by npm.\n\nIt works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp`\nobjects.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar minimatch = require("minimatch")\n\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.foo") // true!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.bar") // false!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.+(bar|foo)", { debug: true }) // true, and noisy!\n```\n\n## Features\n\nSupports these glob features:\n\n* Brace Expansion\n* Extended glob matching\n* "Globstar" `**` matching\n\nSee:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash`\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n\n## Minimatch Class\n\nCreate a minimatch object by instantiating the `minimatch.Minimatch` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Minimatch = require("minimatch").Minimatch\nvar mm = new Minimatch(pattern, options)\n```\n\n### Properties\n\n* `pattern` The original pattern the minimatch object represents.\n* `options` The options supplied to the constructor.\n* `set` A 2-dimensional array of regexp or string expressions.\n  Each row in the\n  array corresponds to a brace-expanded pattern.  Each item in the row\n  corresponds to a single path-part.  For example, the pattern\n  `{a,b/c}/d` would expand to a set of patterns like:\n\n        [ [ a, d ]\n        , [ b, c, d ] ]\n\n    If a portion of the pattern doesn\'t have any "magic" in it\n    (that is, it\'s something like `"foo"` rather than `fo*o?`), then it\n    will be left as a string rather than converted to a regular\n    expression.\n\n* `regexp` Created by the `makeRe` method.  A single regular expression\n  expressing the entire pattern.  This is useful in cases where you wish\n  to use the pattern somewhat like `fnmatch(3)` with `FNM_PATH` enabled.\n* `negate` True if the pattern is negated.\n* `comment` True if the pattern is a comment.\n* `empty` True if the pattern is `""`.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `makeRe` Generate the `regexp` member if necessary, and return it.\n  Will return `false` if the pattern is invalid.\n* `match(fname)` Return true if the filename matches the pattern, or\n  false otherwise.\n* `matchOne(fileArray, patternArray, partial)` Take a `/`-split\n  filename, and match it against a single row in the `regExpSet`.  This\n  method is mainly for internal use, but is exposed so that it can be\n  used by a glob-walker that needs to avoid excessive filesystem calls.\n\nAll other methods are internal, and will be called as necessary.\n\n### minimatch(path, pattern, options)\n\nMain export.  Tests a path against the pattern using the options.\n\n```javascript\nvar isJS = minimatch(file, "*.js", { matchBase: true })\n```\n\n### minimatch.filter(pattern, options)\n\nReturns a function that tests its\nsupplied argument, suitable for use with `Array.filter`.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = fileList.filter(minimatch.filter("*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.match(list, pattern, options)\n\nMatch against the list of\nfiles, in the style of fnmatch or glob.  If nothing is matched, and\noptions.nonull is set, then return a list containing the pattern itself.\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = minimatch.match(fileList, "*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.makeRe(pattern, options)\n\nMake a regular expression object from the pattern.\n\n## Options\n\nAll options are `false` by default.\n\n### debug\n\nDump a ton of stuff to stderr.\n\n### nobrace\n\nDo not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.\n\n### noglobstar\n\nDisable `**` matching against multiple folder names.\n\n### dot\n\nAllow patterns to match filenames starting with a period, even if\nthe pattern does not explicitly have a period in that spot.\n\nNote that by default, `a/**/b` will **not** match `a/.d/b`, unless `dot`\nis set.\n\n### noext\n\nDisable "extglob" style patterns like `+(a|b)`.\n\n### nocase\n\nPerform a case-insensitive match.\n\n### nonull\n\nWhen a match is not found by `minimatch.match`, return a list containing\nthe pattern itself if this option is set.  When not set, an empty list\nis returned if there are no matches.\n\n### matchBase\n\nIf set, then patterns without slashes will be matched\nagainst the basename of the path if it contains slashes.  For example,\n`a?b` would match the path `/xyz/123/acb`, but not `/xyz/acb/123`.\n\n### nocomment\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating `#` at the start of a pattern as a\ncomment.\n\n### nonegate\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating a leading `!` character as negation.\n\n### flipNegate\n\nReturns from negate expressions the same as if they were not negated.\n(Ie, true on a hit, false on a miss.)\n\n\n## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations\n\nWhile strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile\ngoal, some discrepancies exist between minimatch and other\nimplementations, and are intentional.\n\nIf the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the\n`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`\ncharacters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the\npattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`\ncharacters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple\ntimes.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and\nwill not match anything.  Use `\\#` to match a literal `#` at the\nstart of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.\n\nThe double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the\n`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob\nand bash 4.1, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only\nthing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but\n`a/**b` will not.\n\nIf an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,\nthen minimatch.match returns the pattern as-provided, rather than\ninterpreting the character escapes.  For example,\n`minimatch.match([], "\\\\*a\\\\?")` will return `"\\\\*a\\\\?"` rather than\n`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except\nthat it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\n\nIf brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any\nother interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like\n`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded\n**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are\nchecked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.\n',

The set\nof primitive `operators` is:\n\n* `<` Less than\n* `<=` Less than or equal to\n* `>` Greater than\n* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,\n  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n\nFor example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nComparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,\nwhich is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators\nit includes.\n\nA range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A\nversion matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least\none of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.\n\nFor example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nThe range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,\n`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.\n\n### Prerelease Tags\n\nIf a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then\nit will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one\ncomparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a\nprerelease tag.\n\nFor example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the\nversion `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by\n`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater\nthan" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version\nrange only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The\nversion `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a\nprerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.\n\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions\nfrequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes\nthat are (by the author\'s design) not yet fit for public consumption.\nTherefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching\nsemantics.\n\nSecond, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has\nclearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of\nalpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,\nthe user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be\nadditive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.\n\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `^0.0.3` := `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`\n* `^1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n* `^0.0.3-beta` := `>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4`  Note that prereleases in the\n  `0.0.3` version *only* will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta`.  So, `0.0.3-pr.2` would be allowed.\n\nWhen parsing caret ranges, a missing `patch` value desugars to the\nnumber `0`, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the\nmajor and minor versions are both `0`.\n\n* `^1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n* `^0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n\nA missing `minor` and `patch` values will desugar to zero, but also\nallow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is\nzero.\n\n* `^1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n\n### Range Grammar\n\nPutting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,\nfor the benefit of parser authors:\n\n```bnf\nrange-set  ::= range ( logical-or range ) *\nlogical-or ::= ( \' \' ) * \'||\' ( \' \' ) *\nrange      ::= hyphen | simple ( \' \' simple ) * | \'\'\nhyphen     ::= partial \' - \' partial\nsimple     ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret\nprimitive  ::= ( \'<\' | \'>\' | \'>=\' | \'<=\' | \'=\' | ) partial\npartial    ::= xr ( \'.\' xr ( \'.\' xr qualifier ? )? )?\nxr         ::= \'x\' | \'X\' | \'*\' | nr\nnr         ::= \'0\' | [\'1\'-\'9\'] ( [\'0\'-\'9\'] ) *\ntilde      ::= \'~\' partial\ncaret      ::= \'^\' partial\nqualifier  ::= ( \'-\' pre )?

The set\nof primitive `operators` is:\n\n* `<` Less than\n* `<=` Less than or equal to\n* `>` Greater than\n* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,\n  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n\nFor example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nComparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,\nwhich is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators\nit includes.\n\nA range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A\nversion matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least\none of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.\n\nFor example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nThe range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,\n`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.\n\n### Prerelease Tags\n\nIf a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then\nit will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one\ncomparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a\nprerelease tag.\n\nFor example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the\nversion `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by\n`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater\nthan" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version\nrange only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The\nversion `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a\nprerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.\n\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions\nfrequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes\nthat are (by the author\'s design) not yet fit for public consumption.\nTherefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching\nsemantics.\n\nSecond, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has\nclearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of\nalpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,\nthe user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be\nadditive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.\n\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `^0.0.3` := `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`\n* `^1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n* `^0.0.3-beta` := `>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4`  Note that prereleases in the\n  `0.0.3` version *only* will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta`.  So, `0.0.3-pr.2` would be allowed.\n\nWhen parsing caret ranges, a missing `patch` value desugars to the\nnumber `0`, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the\nmajor and minor versions are both `0`.\n\n* `^1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n* `^0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n\nA missing `minor` and `patch` values will desugar to zero, but also\nallow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is\nzero.\n\n* `^1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n\n### Range Grammar\n\nPutting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,\nfor the benefit of parser authors:\n\n```bnf\nrange-set  ::= range ( logical-or range ) *\nlogical-or ::= ( \' \' ) * \'||\' ( \' \' ) *\nrange      ::= hyphen | simple ( \' \' simple ) * | \'\'\nhyphen     ::= partial \' - \' partial\nsimple     ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret\nprimitive  ::= ( \'<\' | \'>\' | \'>=\' | \'<=\' | \'=\' | ) partial\npartial    ::= xr ( \'.\' xr ( \'.\' xr qualifier ? )? )?\nxr         ::= \'x\' | \'X\' | \'*\' | nr\nnr         ::= \'0\' | [\'1\'-\'9\'] ( [\'0\'-\'9\'] ) *\ntilde      ::= \'~\' partial\ncaret      ::= \'^\' partial\nqualifier  ::= ( \'-\' pre )?

The set\nof primitive `operators` is:\n\n* `<` Less than\n* `<=` Less than or equal to\n* `>` Greater than\n* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,\n  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n\nFor example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nComparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,\nwhich is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators\nit includes.\n\nA range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A\nversion matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least\none of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.\n\nFor example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nThe range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,\n`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.\n\n### Prerelease Tags\n\nIf a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then\nit will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one\ncomparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a\nprerelease tag.\n\nFor example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the\nversion `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by\n`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater\nthan" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version\nrange only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The\nversion `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a\nprerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.\n\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions\nfrequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes\nthat are (by the author\'s design) not yet fit for public consumption.\nTherefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching\nsemantics.\n\nSecond, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has\nclearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of\nalpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,\nthe user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be\nadditive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.\n\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `^0.0.3` := `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`\n* `^1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n* `^0.0.3-beta` := `>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4`  Note that prereleases in the\n  `0.0.3` version *only* will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta`.  So, `0.0.3-pr.2` would be allowed.\n\nWhen parsing caret ranges, a missing `patch` value desugars to the\nnumber `0`, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the\nmajor and minor versions are both `0`.\n\n* `^1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n* `^0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n\nA missing `minor` and `patch` values will desugar to zero, but also\nallow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is\nzero.\n\n* `^1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n\n### Range Grammar\n\nPutting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,\nfor the benefit of parser authors:\n\n```bnf\nrange-set  ::= range ( logical-or range ) *\nlogical-or ::= ( \' \' ) * \'||\' ( \' \' ) *\nrange      ::= hyphen | simple ( \' \' simple ) * | \'\'\nhyphen     ::= partial \' - \' partial\nsimple     ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret\nprimitive  ::= ( \'<\' | \'>\' | \'>=\' | \'<=\' | \'=\' | ) partial\npartial    ::= xr ( \'.\' xr ( \'.\' xr qualifier ? )? )?\nxr         ::= \'x\' | \'X\' | \'*\' | nr\nnr         ::= \'0\' | [\'1\'-\'9\'] ( [\'0\'-\'9\'] ) *\ntilde      ::= \'~\' partial\ncaret      ::= \'^\' partial\nqualifier  ::= ( \'-\' pre )? ( \'+\' build )?\npre        ::= parts\nbuild      ::= parts\nparts      ::= part ( \'.\' part ) *\npart       ::= nr | [-0-9A-Za-z]+\n```\n\n## Functions\n\nAll methods and classes take a final `loose` boolean argument that, if\ntrue, will be more forgiving about not-quite-valid semver strings.\nThe resulting output will always be 100% strict, of course.\n\nStrict-mode Comparators and Ranges will be strict about the SemVer\nstrings that they parse.\n\n* `valid(v)`: Return the parsed version, or null if it\'s not valid.\n* `inc(v, release)`: Return the version incremented by the release\n  type (`major`,   `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`,\n  `prepatch`, or `prerelease`), or null if it\'s not valid\n  * `premajor` in one call will bump the version up to the next major\n    version and down to a prerelease of that major version.\n    `preminor`, and `prepatch` work the same way.\n  * If called from a non-prerelease version, the `prerelease` will work the\n    same as `prepatch`. It increments the patch version, then makes a\n    prerelease. If the input version is already a prerelease it simply\n    increments it.\n* `prerelease(v)`: Returns an array of prerelease components, or null\n  if none exist. Example: `prerelease(\'1.2.3-alpha.1\') -> [\'alpha\', 1]`\n* `major(v)`: Return the major version number.\n* `minor(v)`: Return the minor version number.\n* `patch(v)`: Return the patch version number.\n\n### Comparison\n\n* `gt(v1, v2)`: `v1 > v2`\n* `gte(v1, v2)`: `v1 >= v2`\n* `lt(v1, v2)`: `v1 < v2`\n* `lte(v1, v2)`: `v1 <= v2`\n* `eq(v1, v2)`: `v1 == v2` This is true if they\'re logically equivalent,\n  even if they\'re not the exact same string.  You already know how to\n  compare strings.\n* `neq(v1, v2)`: `v1 != v2` The opposite of `eq`.\n* `cmp(v1, comparator, v2)`: Pass in a comparison string, and it\'ll call\n  the corresponding function above.  `"==="` and `"!=="` do simple\n  string comparison, but are included for completeness.  Throws if an\n  invalid comparison string is provided.\n* `compare(v1, v2)`: Return `0` if `v1 == v2`, or `1` if `v1` is greater, or `-1` if\n  `v2` is greater.  Sorts in ascending order if passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `rcompare(v1, v2)`: The reverse of compare.  Sorts an array of versions\n  in descending order when passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `diff(v1, v2)`: Returns difference between two versions by the release type\n  (`major`, `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`, `prepatch`, or `prerelease`),\n  or null if the versions are the same.\n\n\n### Ranges\n\n* `validRange(range)`: Return the valid range or null if it\'s not valid\n* `satisfies(version, range)`: Return true if the version satisfies the\n  range.\n* `maxSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the highest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `minSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the lowest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `gtr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is greater than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `ltr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is less than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `outside(version, range, hilo)`: Return true if the version is outside\n  the bounds of the range in either the high or low direction.  The\n  `hilo` argument must be either the string `\'>\'` or `\'<\'`.  (This is\n  the function called by `gtr` and `ltr`.)\n\nNote that, since ranges may be non-contiguous, a version might not be\ngreater than a range, less than a range, *or* satisfy a range!  For\nexample, the range `1.2 <1.2.9 || >2.0.0` would have a hole from `1.2.9`\nuntil `2.0.0`, so the version `1.2.10` would not be greater than the\nrange (because `2.0.1` satisfies, which is higher), nor less than the\nrange (since `1.2.8` satisfies, which is lower), and it also does not\nsatisfy the range.\n\nIf you want to know if a version satisfies or does not satisfy a\nrange, use the `satisfies(version, range)` function.\n',

However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be\nadditive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.\n\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `^0.0.3` := `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`\n* `^1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n* `^0.0.3-beta` := `>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4`  Note that prereleases in the\n  `0.0.3` version *only* will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta`.  So, `0.0.3-pr.2` would be allowed.\n\nWhen parsing caret ranges, a missing `patch` value desugars to the\nnumber `0`, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the\nmajor and minor versions are both `0`.\n\n* `^1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n* `^0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n\nA missing `minor` and `patch` values will desugar to zero, but also\nallow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is\nzero.\n\n* `^1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n\n### Range Grammar\n\nPutting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,\nfor the benefit of parser authors:\n\n```bnf\nrange-set  ::= range ( logical-or range ) *\nlogical-or ::= ( \' \' ) * \'||\' ( \' \' ) *\nrange      ::= hyphen | simple ( \' \' simple ) * | \'\'\nhyphen     ::= partial \' - \' partial\nsimple     ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret\nprimitive  ::= ( \'<\' | \'>\' | \'>=\' | \'<=\' | \'=\' | ) partial\npartial    ::= xr ( \'.\' xr ( \'.\' xr qualifier ? )? )?\nxr         ::= \'x\' | \'X\' | \'*\' | nr\nnr         ::= \'0\' | [\'1\'-\'9\'] ( [\'0\'-\'9\'] ) *\ntilde      ::= \'~\' partial\ncaret      ::= \'^\' partial\nqualifier  ::= ( \'-\' pre )? ( \'+\' build )?\npre        ::= parts\nbuild      ::= parts\nparts      ::= part ( \'.\' part ) *\npart       ::= nr | [-0-9A-Za-z]+\n```\n\n## Functions\n\nAll methods and classes take a final `loose` boolean argument that, if\ntrue, will be more forgiving about not-quite-valid semver strings.\nThe resulting output will always be 100% strict, of course.\n\nStrict-mode Comparators and Ranges will be strict about the SemVer\nstrings that they parse.\n\n* `valid(v)`: Return the parsed version, or null if it\'s not valid.\n* `inc(v, release)`: Return the version incremented by the release\n  type (`major`,   `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`,\n  `prepatch`, or `prerelease`), or null if it\'s not valid\n  * `premajor` in one call will bump the version up to the next major\n    version and down to a prerelease of that major version.\n    `preminor`, and `prepatch` work the same way.\n  * If called from a non-prerelease version, the `prerelease` will work the\n    same as `prepatch`. It increments the patch version, then makes a\n    prerelease. If the input version is already a prerelease it simply\n    increments it.\n* `prerelease(v)`: Returns an array of prerelease components, or null\n  if none exist. Example: `prerelease(\'1.2.3-alpha.1\') -> [\'alpha\', 1]`\n* `major(v)`: Return the major version number.\n* `minor(v)`: Return the minor version number.\n* `patch(v)`: Return the patch version number.\n\n### Comparison\n\n* `gt(v1, v2)`: `v1 > v2`\n* `gte(v1, v2)`: `v1 >= v2`\n* `lt(v1, v2)`: `v1 < v2`\n* `lte(v1, v2)`: `v1 <= v2`\n* `eq(v1, v2)`: `v1 == v2` This is true if they\'re logically equivalent,\n  even if they\'re not the exact same string.  You already know how to\n  compare strings.\n* `neq(v1, v2)`: `v1 != v2` The opposite of `eq`.\n* `cmp(v1, comparator, v2)`: Pass in a comparison string, and it\'ll call\n  the corresponding function above.  `"==="` and `"!=="` do simple\n  string comparison, but are included for completeness.  Throws if an\n  invalid comparison string is provided.\n* `compare(v1, v2)`: Return `0` if `v1 == v2`, or `1` if `v1` is greater, or `-1` if\n  `v2` is greater.  Sorts in ascending order if passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `rcompare(v1, v2)`: The reverse of compare.  Sorts an array of versions\n  in descending order when passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `diff(v1, v2)`: Returns difference between two versions by the release type\n  (`major`, `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`, `prepatch`, or `prerelease`),\n  or null if the versions are the same.\n\n\n### Ranges\n\n* `validRange(range)`: Return the valid range or null if it\'s not valid\n* `satisfies(version, range)`: Return true if the version satisfies the\n  range.\n* `maxSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the highest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `minSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the lowest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `gtr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is greater than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `ltr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is less than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `outside(version, range, hilo)`: Return true if the version is outside\n  the bounds of the range in either the high or low direction.  The\n  `hilo` argument must be either the string `\'>\'` or `\'<\'`.  (This is\n  the function called by `gtr` and `ltr`.)\n\nNote that, since ranges may be non-contiguous, a version might not be\ngreater than a range, less than a range, *or* satisfy a range!  For\nexample, the range `1.2 <1.2.9 || >2.0.0` would have a hole from `1.2.9`\nuntil `2.0.0`, so the version `1.2.10` would not be greater than the\nrange (because `2.0.1` satisfies, which is higher), nor less than the\nrange (since `1.2.8` satisfies, which is lower), and it also does not\nsatisfy the range.\n\nIf you want to know if a version satisfies or does not satisfy a\nrange, use the `satisfies(version, range)` function.\n',

The set\nof primitive `operators` is:\n\n* `<` Less than\n* `<=` Less than or equal to\n* `>` Greater than\n* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,\n  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n\nFor example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nComparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,\nwhich is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators\nit includes.\n\nA range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A\nversion matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least\none of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.\n\nFor example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nThe range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,\n`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.\n\n### Prerelease Tags\n\nIf a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then\nit will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one\ncomparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a\nprerelease tag.\n\nFor example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the\nversion `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by\n`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater\nthan" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version\nrange only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The\nversion `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a\nprerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.\n\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions\nfrequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes\nthat are (by the author\'s design) not yet fit for public consumption.\nTherefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching\nsemantics.\n\nSecond, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has\nclearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of\nalpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,\nthe user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.

The set\nof primitive `operators` is:\n\n* `<` Less than\n* `<=` Less than or equal to\n* `>` Greater than\n* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,\n  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n\nFor example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nComparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,\nwhich is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators\nit includes.\n\nA range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A\nversion matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least\none of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.\n\nFor example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nThe range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,\n`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.\n\n### Prerelease Tags\n\nIf a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then\nit will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one\ncomparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a\nprerelease tag.\n\nFor example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the\nversion `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by\n`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater\nthan" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version\nrange only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The\nversion `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a\nprerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.\n\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions\nfrequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes\nthat are (by the author\'s design) not yet fit for public consumption.\nTherefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching\nsemantics.\n\nSecond, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has\nclearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of\nalpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,\nthe user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be\nadditive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.\n\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `^0.0.3` := `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`\n* `^1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n* `^0.0.3-beta` := `>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4`  Note that prereleases in the\n  `0.0.3` version *only* will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta`.  So, `0.0.3-pr.2` would be allowed.\n\nWhen parsing caret ranges, a missing `patch` value desugars to the\nnumber `0`, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the\nmajor and minor versions are both `0`.\n\n* `^1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n* `^0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n\nA missing `minor` and `patch` values will desugar to zero, but also\nallow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is\nzero.\n\n* `^1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n\n### Range Grammar\n\nPutting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,\nfor the benefit of parser authors:\n\n```bnf\nrange-set  ::= range ( logical-or range ) *\nlogical-or ::= ( \' \' ) * \'||\' ( \' \' ) *\nrange      ::= hyphen | simple ( \' \' simple ) * | \'\'\nhyphen     ::= partial \' - \' partial\nsimple     ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret\nprimitive  ::= ( \'<\' | \'>\' | \'>=\' | \'<=\' | \'=\' | ) partial\npartial    ::= xr ( \'.\' xr ( \'.\' xr qualifier ? )? )?\nxr         ::= \'x\' | \'X\' | \'*\' | nr\nnr         ::= \'0\' | [\'1\'-\'9\'] ( [\'0\'-\'9\'] ) *\ntilde      ::= \'~\' partial\ncaret      ::= \'^\' partial\nqualifier  ::= ( \'-\' pre )?

The set\nof primitive `operators` is:\n\n* `<` Less than\n* `<=` Less than or equal to\n* `>` Greater than\n* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,\n  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n\nFor example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nComparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,\nwhich is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators\nit includes.\n\nA range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A\nversion matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least\none of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.\n\nFor example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nThe range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,\n`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.\n\n### Prerelease Tags\n\nIf a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then\nit will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one\ncomparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a\nprerelease tag.\n\nFor example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the\nversion `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by\n`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater\nthan" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version\nrange only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The\nversion `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a\nprerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.\n\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions\nfrequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes\nthat are (by the author\'s design) not yet fit for public consumption.\nTherefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching\nsemantics.\n\nSecond, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has\nclearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of\nalpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,\nthe user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be\nadditive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.\n\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `^0.0.3` := `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`\n* `^1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n* `^0.0.3-beta` := `>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4`  Note that prereleases in the\n  `0.0.3` version *only* will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta`.  So, `0.0.3-pr.2` would be allowed.\n\nWhen parsing caret ranges, a missing `patch` value desugars to the\nnumber `0`, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the\nmajor and minor versions are both `0`.\n\n* `^1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n* `^0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n\nA missing `minor` and `patch` values will desugar to zero, but also\nallow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is\nzero.\n\n* `^1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n\n### Range Grammar\n\nPutting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,\nfor the benefit of parser authors:\n\n```bnf\nrange-set  ::= range ( logical-or range ) *\nlogical-or ::= ( \' \' ) * \'||\' ( \' \' ) *\nrange      ::= hyphen | simple ( \' \' simple ) * | \'\'\nhyphen     ::= partial \' - \' partial\nsimple     ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret\nprimitive  ::= ( \'<\' | \'>\' | \'>=\' | \'<=\' | \'=\' | ) partial\npartial    ::= xr ( \'.\' xr ( \'.\' xr qualifier ? )? )?\nxr         ::= \'x\' | \'X\' | \'*\' | nr\nnr         ::= \'0\' | [\'1\'-\'9\'] ( [\'0\'-\'9\'] ) *\ntilde      ::= \'~\' partial\ncaret      ::= \'^\' partial\nqualifier  ::= ( \'-\' pre )? ( \'+\' build )?\npre        ::= parts\nbuild      ::= parts\nparts      ::= part ( \'.\' part ) *\npart       ::= nr | [-0-9A-Za-z]+\n```\n\n## Functions\n\nAll methods and classes take a final `loose` boolean argument that, if\ntrue, will be more forgiving about not-quite-valid semver strings.\nThe resulting output will always be 100% strict, of course.\n\nStrict-mode Comparators and Ranges will be strict about the SemVer\nstrings that they parse.\n\n* `valid(v)`: Return the parsed version, or null if it\'s not valid.\n* `inc(v, release)`: Return the version incremented by the release\n  type (`major`,   `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`,\n  `prepatch`, or `prerelease`), or null if it\'s not valid\n  * `premajor` in one call will bump the version up to the next major\n    version and down to a prerelease of that major version.\n    `preminor`, and `prepatch` work the same way.\n  * If called from a non-prerelease version, the `prerelease` will work the\n    same as `prepatch`. It increments the patch version, then makes a\n    prerelease. If the input version is already a prerelease it simply\n    increments it.\n* `prerelease(v)`: Returns an array of prerelease components, or null\n  if none exist. Example: `prerelease(\'1.2.3-alpha.1\') -> [\'alpha\', 1]`\n* `major(v)`: Return the major version number.\n* `minor(v)`: Return the minor version number.\n* `patch(v)`: Return the patch version number.\n\n### Comparison\n\n* `gt(v1, v2)`: `v1 > v2`\n* `gte(v1, v2)`: `v1 >= v2`\n* `lt(v1, v2)`: `v1 < v2`\n* `lte(v1, v2)`: `v1 <= v2`\n* `eq(v1, v2)`: `v1 == v2` This is true if they\'re logically equivalent,\n  even if they\'re not the exact same string.  You already know how to\n  compare strings.\n* `neq(v1, v2)`: `v1 != v2` The opposite of `eq`.\n* `cmp(v1, comparator, v2)`: Pass in a comparison string, and it\'ll call\n  the corresponding function above.  `"==="` and `"!=="` do simple\n  string comparison, but are included for completeness.  Throws if an\n  invalid comparison string is provided.\n* `compare(v1, v2)`: Return `0` if `v1 == v2`, or `1` if `v1` is greater, or `-1` if\n  `v2` is greater.  Sorts in ascending order if passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `rcompare(v1, v2)`: The reverse of compare.  Sorts an array of versions\n  in descending order when passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `diff(v1, v2)`: Returns difference between two versions by the release type\n  (`major`, `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`, `prepatch`, or `prerelease`),\n  or null if the versions are the same.\n\n\n### Ranges\n\n* `validRange(range)`: Return the valid range or null if it\'s not valid\n* `satisfies(version, range)`: Return true if the version satisfies the\n  range.\n* `maxSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the highest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `minSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the lowest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `gtr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is greater than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `ltr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is less than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `outside(version, range, hilo)`: Return true if the version is outside\n  the bounds of the range in either the high or low direction.  The\n  `hilo` argument must be either the string `\'>\'` or `\'<\'`.  (This is\n  the function called by `gtr` and `ltr`.)\n\nNote that, since ranges may be non-contiguous, a version might not be\ngreater than a range, less than a range, *or* satisfy a range!  For\nexample, the range `1.2 <1.2.9 || >2.0.0` would have a hole from `1.2.9`\nuntil `2.0.0`, so the version `1.2.10` would not be greater than the\nrange (because `2.0.1` satisfies, which is higher), nor less than the\nrange (since `1.2.8` satisfies, which is lower), and it also does not\nsatisfy the range.\n\nIf you want to know if a version satisfies or does not satisfy a\nrange, use the `satisfies(version, range)` function.\n',

However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be\nadditive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.\n\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `^0.0.3` := `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`\n* `^1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n* `^0.0.3-beta` := `>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4`  Note that prereleases in the\n  `0.0.3` version *only* will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta`.  So, `0.0.3-pr.2` would be allowed.\n\nWhen parsing caret ranges, a missing `patch` value desugars to the\nnumber `0`, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the\nmajor and minor versions are both `0`.\n\n* `^1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n* `^0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n\nA missing `minor` and `patch` values will desugar to zero, but also\nallow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is\nzero.\n\n* `^1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n\n### Range Grammar\n\nPutting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,\nfor the benefit of parser authors:\n\n```bnf\nrange-set  ::= range ( logical-or range ) *\nlogical-or ::= ( \' \' ) * \'||\' ( \' \' ) *\nrange      ::= hyphen | simple ( \' \' simple ) * | \'\'\nhyphen     ::= partial \' - \' partial\nsimple     ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret\nprimitive  ::= ( \'<\' | \'>\' | \'>=\' | \'<=\' | \'=\' | ) partial\npartial    ::= xr ( \'.\' xr ( \'.\' xr qualifier ? )? )?\nxr         ::= \'x\' | \'X\' | \'*\' | nr\nnr         ::= \'0\' | [\'1\'-\'9\'] ( [\'0\'-\'9\'] ) *\ntilde      ::= \'~\' partial\ncaret      ::= \'^\' partial\nqualifier  ::= ( \'-\' pre )? ( \'+\' build )?\npre        ::= parts\nbuild      ::= parts\nparts      ::= part ( \'.\' part ) *\npart       ::= nr | [-0-9A-Za-z]+\n```\n\n## Functions\n\nAll methods and classes take a final `loose` boolean argument that, if\ntrue, will be more forgiving about not-quite-valid semver strings.\nThe resulting output will always be 100% strict, of course.\n\nStrict-mode Comparators and Ranges will be strict about the SemVer\nstrings that they parse.\n\n* `valid(v)`: Return the parsed version, or null if it\'s not valid.\n* `inc(v, release)`: Return the version incremented by the release\n  type (`major`,   `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`,\n  `prepatch`, or `prerelease`), or null if it\'s not valid\n  * `premajor` in one call will bump the version up to the next major\n    version and down to a prerelease of that major version.\n    `preminor`, and `prepatch` work the same way.\n  * If called from a non-prerelease version, the `prerelease` will work the\n    same as `prepatch`. It increments the patch version, then makes a\n    prerelease. If the input version is already a prerelease it simply\n    increments it.\n* `prerelease(v)`: Returns an array of prerelease components, or null\n  if none exist. Example: `prerelease(\'1.2.3-alpha.1\') -> [\'alpha\', 1]`\n* `major(v)`: Return the major version number.\n* `minor(v)`: Return the minor version number.\n* `patch(v)`: Return the patch version number.\n\n### Comparison\n\n* `gt(v1, v2)`: `v1 > v2`\n* `gte(v1, v2)`: `v1 >= v2`\n* `lt(v1, v2)`: `v1 < v2`\n* `lte(v1, v2)`: `v1 <= v2`\n* `eq(v1, v2)`: `v1 == v2` This is true if they\'re logically equivalent,\n  even if they\'re not the exact same string.  You already know how to\n  compare strings.\n* `neq(v1, v2)`: `v1 != v2` The opposite of `eq`.\n* `cmp(v1, comparator, v2)`: Pass in a comparison string, and it\'ll call\n  the corresponding function above.  `"==="` and `"!=="` do simple\n  string comparison, but are included for completeness.  Throws if an\n  invalid comparison string is provided.\n* `compare(v1, v2)`: Return `0` if `v1 == v2`, or `1` if `v1` is greater, or `-1` if\n  `v2` is greater.  Sorts in ascending order if passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `rcompare(v1, v2)`: The reverse of compare.  Sorts an array of versions\n  in descending order when passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `diff(v1, v2)`: Returns difference between two versions by the release type\n  (`major`, `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`, `prepatch`, or `prerelease`),\n  or null if the versions are the same.\n\n\n### Ranges\n\n* `validRange(range)`: Return the valid range or null if it\'s not valid\n* `satisfies(version, range)`: Return true if the version satisfies the\n  range.\n* `maxSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the highest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `minSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the lowest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `gtr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is greater than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `ltr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is less than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `outside(version, range, hilo)`: Return true if the version is outside\n  the bounds of the range in either the high or low direction.  The\n  `hilo` argument must be either the string `\'>\'` or `\'<\'`.  (This is\n  the function called by `gtr` and `ltr`.)\n\nNote that, since ranges may be non-contiguous, a version might not be\ngreater than a range, less than a range, *or* satisfy a range!  For\nexample, the range `1.2 <1.2.9 || >2.0.0` would have a hole from `1.2.9`\nuntil `2.0.0`, so the version `1.2.10` would not be greater than the\nrange (because `2.0.1` satisfies, which is higher), nor less than the\nrange (since `1.2.8` satisfies, which is lower), and it also does not\nsatisfy the range.\n\nIf you want to know if a version satisfies or does not satisfy a\nrange, use the `satisfies(version, range)` function.\n',

The set\nof primitive `operators` is:\n\n* `<` Less than\n* `<=` Less than or equal to\n* `>` Greater than\n* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,\n  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n\nFor example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nComparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,\nwhich is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators\nit includes.\n\nA range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A\nversion matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least\none of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.\n\nFor example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nThe range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,\n`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.\n\n### Prerelease Tags\n\nIf a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then\nit will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one\ncomparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a\nprerelease tag.\n\nFor example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the\nversion `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by\n`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater\nthan" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version\nrange only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The\nversion `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a\nprerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.\n\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions\nfrequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes\nthat are (by the author\'s design) not yet fit for public consumption.\nTherefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching\nsemantics.\n\nSecond, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has\nclearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of\nalpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,\nthe user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.

The set\nof primitive `operators` is:\n\n* `<` Less than\n* `<=` Less than or equal to\n* `>` Greater than\n* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,\n  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n\nFor example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nComparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,\nwhich is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators\nit includes.\n\nA range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A\nversion matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least\none of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.\n\nFor example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nThe range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,\n`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.\n\n### Prerelease Tags\n\nIf a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then\nit will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one\ncomparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a\nprerelease tag.\n\nFor example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the\nversion `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by\n`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater\nthan" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version\nrange only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The\nversion `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a\nprerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.\n\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions\nfrequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes\nthat are (by the author\'s design) not yet fit for public consumption.\nTherefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching\nsemantics.\n\nSecond, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has\nclearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of\nalpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,\nthe user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be\nadditive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.\n\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `^0.0.3` := `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`\n* `^1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n* `^0.0.3-beta` := `>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4`  Note that prereleases in the\n  `0.0.3` version *only* will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta`.  So, `0.0.3-pr.2` would be allowed.\n\nWhen parsing caret ranges, a missing `patch` value desugars to the\nnumber `0`, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the\nmajor and minor versions are both `0`.\n\n* `^1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n* `^0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n\nA missing `minor` and `patch` values will desugar to zero, but also\nallow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is\nzero.\n\n* `^1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n\n### Range Grammar\n\nPutting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,\nfor the benefit of parser authors:\n\n```bnf\nrange-set  ::= range ( logical-or range ) *\nlogical-or ::= ( \' \' ) * \'||\' ( \' \' ) *\nrange      ::= hyphen | simple ( \' \' simple ) * | \'\'\nhyphen     ::= partial \' - \' partial\nsimple     ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret\nprimitive  ::= ( \'<\' | \'>\' | \'>=\' | \'<=\' | \'=\' | ) partial\npartial    ::= xr ( \'.\' xr ( \'.\' xr qualifier ? )? )?\nxr         ::= \'x\' | \'X\' | \'*\' | nr\nnr         ::= \'0\' | [\'1\'-\'9\'] ( [\'0\'-\'9\'] ) *\ntilde      ::= \'~\' partial\ncaret      ::= \'^\' partial\nqualifier  ::= ( \'-\' pre )?

The set\nof primitive `operators` is:\n\n* `<` Less than\n* `<=` Less than or equal to\n* `>` Greater than\n* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,\n  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n\nFor example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nComparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,\nwhich is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators\nit includes.\n\nA range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A\nversion matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least\none of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.\n\nFor example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nThe range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,\n`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.\n\n### Prerelease Tags\n\nIf a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then\nit will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one\ncomparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a\nprerelease tag.\n\nFor example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the\nversion `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by\n`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater\nthan" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version\nrange only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The\nversion `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a\nprerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.\n\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions\nfrequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes\nthat are (by the author\'s design) not yet fit for public consumption.\nTherefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching\nsemantics.\n\nSecond, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has\nclearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of\nalpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,\nthe user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be\nadditive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.\n\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `^0.0.3` := `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`\n* `^1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n* `^0.0.3-beta` := `>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4`  Note that prereleases in the\n  `0.0.3` version *only* will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta`.  So, `0.0.3-pr.2` would be allowed.\n\nWhen parsing caret ranges, a missing `patch` value desugars to the\nnumber `0`, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the\nmajor and minor versions are both `0`.\n\n* `^1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n* `^0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n\nA missing `minor` and `patch` values will desugar to zero, but also\nallow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is\nzero.\n\n* `^1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n\n### Range Grammar\n\nPutting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,\nfor the benefit of parser authors:\n\n```bnf\nrange-set  ::= range ( logical-or range ) *\nlogical-or ::= ( \' \' ) * \'||\' ( \' \' ) *\nrange      ::= hyphen | simple ( \' \' simple ) * | \'\'\nhyphen     ::= partial \' - \' partial\nsimple     ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret\nprimitive  ::= ( \'<\' | \'>\' | \'>=\' | \'<=\' | \'=\' | ) partial\npartial    ::= xr ( \'.\' xr ( \'.\' xr qualifier ? )? )?\nxr         ::= \'x\' | \'X\' | \'*\' | nr\nnr         ::= \'0\' | [\'1\'-\'9\'] ( [\'0\'-\'9\'] ) *\ntilde      ::= \'~\' partial\ncaret      ::= \'^\' partial\nqualifier  ::= ( \'-\' pre )? ( \'+\' build )?\npre        ::= parts\nbuild      ::= parts\nparts      ::= part ( \'.\' part ) *\npart       ::= nr | [-0-9A-Za-z]+\n```\n\n## Functions\n\nAll methods and classes take a final `loose` boolean argument that, if\ntrue, will be more forgiving about not-quite-valid semver strings.\nThe resulting output will always be 100% strict, of course.\n\nStrict-mode Comparators and Ranges will be strict about the SemVer\nstrings that they parse.\n\n* `valid(v)`: Return the parsed version, or null if it\'s not valid.\n* `inc(v, release)`: Return the version incremented by the release\n  type (`major`,   `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`,\n  `prepatch`, or `prerelease`), or null if it\'s not valid\n  * `premajor` in one call will bump the version up to the next major\n    version and down to a prerelease of that major version.\n    `preminor`, and `prepatch` work the same way.\n  * If called from a non-prerelease version, the `prerelease` will work the\n    same as `prepatch`. It increments the patch version, then makes a\n    prerelease. If the input version is already a prerelease it simply\n    increments it.\n* `prerelease(v)`: Returns an array of prerelease components, or null\n  if none exist. Example: `prerelease(\'1.2.3-alpha.1\') -> [\'alpha\', 1]`\n* `major(v)`: Return the major version number.\n* `minor(v)`: Return the minor version number.\n* `patch(v)`: Return the patch version number.\n\n### Comparison\n\n* `gt(v1, v2)`: `v1 > v2`\n* `gte(v1, v2)`: `v1 >= v2`\n* `lt(v1, v2)`: `v1 < v2`\n* `lte(v1, v2)`: `v1 <= v2`\n* `eq(v1, v2)`: `v1 == v2` This is true if they\'re logically equivalent,\n  even if they\'re not the exact same string.  You already know how to\n  compare strings.\n* `neq(v1, v2)`: `v1 != v2` The opposite of `eq`.\n* `cmp(v1, comparator, v2)`: Pass in a comparison string, and it\'ll call\n  the corresponding function above.  `"==="` and `"!=="` do simple\n  string comparison, but are included for completeness.  Throws if an\n  invalid comparison string is provided.\n* `compare(v1, v2)`: Return `0` if `v1 == v2`, or `1` if `v1` is greater, or `-1` if\n  `v2` is greater.  Sorts in ascending order if passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `rcompare(v1, v2)`: The reverse of compare.  Sorts an array of versions\n  in descending order when passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `diff(v1, v2)`: Returns difference between two versions by the release type\n  (`major`, `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`, `prepatch`, or `prerelease`),\n  or null if the versions are the same.\n\n\n### Ranges\n\n* `validRange(range)`: Return the valid range or null if it\'s not valid\n* `satisfies(version, range)`: Return true if the version satisfies the\n  range.\n* `maxSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the highest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `minSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the lowest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `gtr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is greater than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `ltr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is less than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `outside(version, range, hilo)`: Return true if the version is outside\n  the bounds of the range in either the high or low direction.  The\n  `hilo` argument must be either the string `\'>\'` or `\'<\'`.  (This is\n  the function called by `gtr` and `ltr`.)\n\nNote that, since ranges may be non-contiguous, a version might not be\ngreater than a range, less than a range, *or* satisfy a range!  For\nexample, the range `1.2 <1.2.9 || >2.0.0` would have a hole from `1.2.9`\nuntil `2.0.0`, so the version `1.2.10` would not be greater than the\nrange (because `2.0.1` satisfies, which is higher), nor less than the\nrange (since `1.2.8` satisfies, which is lower), and it also does not\nsatisfy the range.\n\nIf you want to know if a version satisfies or does not satisfy a\nrange, use the `satisfies(version, range)` function.\n',

However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be\nadditive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.\n\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `^0.0.3` := `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`\n* `^1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n* `^0.0.3-beta` := `>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4`  Note that prereleases in the\n  `0.0.3` version *only* will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta`.  So, `0.0.3-pr.2` would be allowed.\n\nWhen parsing caret ranges, a missing `patch` value desugars to the\nnumber `0`, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the\nmajor and minor versions are both `0`.\n\n* `^1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n* `^0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n\nA missing `minor` and `patch` values will desugar to zero, but also\nallow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is\nzero.\n\n* `^1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n\n### Range Grammar\n\nPutting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,\nfor the benefit of parser authors:\n\n```bnf\nrange-set  ::= range ( logical-or range ) *\nlogical-or ::= ( \' \' ) * \'||\' ( \' \' ) *\nrange      ::= hyphen | simple ( \' \' simple ) * | \'\'\nhyphen     ::= partial \' - \' partial\nsimple     ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret\nprimitive  ::= ( \'<\' | \'>\' | \'>=\' | \'<=\' | \'=\' | ) partial\npartial    ::= xr ( \'.\' xr ( \'.\' xr qualifier ? )? )?\nxr         ::= \'x\' | \'X\' | \'*\' | nr\nnr         ::= \'0\' | [\'1\'-\'9\'] ( [\'0\'-\'9\'] ) *\ntilde      ::= \'~\' partial\ncaret      ::= \'^\' partial\nqualifier  ::= ( \'-\' pre )? ( \'+\' build )?\npre        ::= parts\nbuild      ::= parts\nparts      ::= part ( \'.\' part ) *\npart       ::= nr | [-0-9A-Za-z]+\n```\n\n## Functions\n\nAll methods and classes take a final `loose` boolean argument that, if\ntrue, will be more forgiving about not-quite-valid semver strings.\nThe resulting output will always be 100% strict, of course.\n\nStrict-mode Comparators and Ranges will be strict about the SemVer\nstrings that they parse.\n\n* `valid(v)`: Return the parsed version, or null if it\'s not valid.\n* `inc(v, release)`: Return the version incremented by the release\n  type (`major`,   `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`,\n  `prepatch`, or `prerelease`), or null if it\'s not valid\n  * `premajor` in one call will bump the version up to the next major\n    version and down to a prerelease of that major version.\n    `preminor`, and `prepatch` work the same way.\n  * If called from a non-prerelease version, the `prerelease` will work the\n    same as `prepatch`. It increments the patch version, then makes a\n    prerelease. If the input version is already a prerelease it simply\n    increments it.\n* `prerelease(v)`: Returns an array of prerelease components, or null\n  if none exist. Example: `prerelease(\'1.2.3-alpha.1\') -> [\'alpha\', 1]`\n* `major(v)`: Return the major version number.\n* `minor(v)`: Return the minor version number.\n* `patch(v)`: Return the patch version number.\n\n### Comparison\n\n* `gt(v1, v2)`: `v1 > v2`\n* `gte(v1, v2)`: `v1 >= v2`\n* `lt(v1, v2)`: `v1 < v2`\n* `lte(v1, v2)`: `v1 <= v2`\n* `eq(v1, v2)`: `v1 == v2` This is true if they\'re logically equivalent,\n  even if they\'re not the exact same string.  You already know how to\n  compare strings.\n* `neq(v1, v2)`: `v1 != v2` The opposite of `eq`.\n* `cmp(v1, comparator, v2)`: Pass in a comparison string, and it\'ll call\n  the corresponding function above.  `"==="` and `"!=="` do simple\n  string comparison, but are included for completeness.  Throws if an\n  invalid comparison string is provided.\n* `compare(v1, v2)`: Return `0` if `v1 == v2`, or `1` if `v1` is greater, or `-1` if\n  `v2` is greater.  Sorts in ascending order if passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `rcompare(v1, v2)`: The reverse of compare.  Sorts an array of versions\n  in descending order when passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `diff(v1, v2)`: Returns difference between two versions by the release type\n  (`major`, `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`, `prepatch`, or `prerelease`),\n  or null if the versions are the same.\n\n\n### Ranges\n\n* `validRange(range)`: Return the valid range or null if it\'s not valid\n* `satisfies(version, range)`: Return true if the version satisfies the\n  range.\n* `maxSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the highest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `minSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the lowest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `gtr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is greater than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `ltr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is less than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `outside(version, range, hilo)`: Return true if the version is outside\n  the bounds of the range in either the high or low direction.  The\n  `hilo` argument must be either the string `\'>\'` or `\'<\'`.  (This is\n  the function called by `gtr` and `ltr`.)\n\nNote that, since ranges may be non-contiguous, a version might not be\ngreater than a range, less than a range, *or* satisfy a range!  For\nexample, the range `1.2 <1.2.9 || >2.0.0` would have a hole from `1.2.9`\nuntil `2.0.0`, so the version `1.2.10` would not be greater than the\nrange (because `2.0.1` satisfies, which is higher), nor less than the\nrange (since `1.2.8` satisfies, which is lower), and it also does not\nsatisfy the range.\n\nIf you want to know if a version satisfies or does not satisfy a\nrange, use the `satisfies(version, range)` function.\n',

The set\nof primitive `operators` is:\n\n* `<` Less than\n* `<=` Less than or equal to\n* `>` Greater than\n* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,\n  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n\nFor example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nComparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,\nwhich is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators\nit includes.\n\nA range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A\nversion matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least\none of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.\n\nFor example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nThe range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,\n`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.\n\n### Prerelease Tags\n\nIf a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then\nit will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one\ncomparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a\nprerelease tag.\n\nFor example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the\nversion `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by\n`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater\nthan" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version\nrange only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The\nversion `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a\nprerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.\n\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions\nfrequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes\nthat are (by the author\'s design) not yet fit for public consumption.\nTherefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching\nsemantics.\n\nSecond, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has\nclearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of\nalpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,\nthe user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.

The set\nof primitive `operators` is:\n\n* `<` Less than\n* `<=` Less than or equal to\n* `>` Greater than\n* `>=` Greater than or equal to\n* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,\n  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n\nFor example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nComparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,\nwhich is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators\nit includes.\n\nA range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A\nversion matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least\none of the `||`-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.\n\nFor example, the range `>=1.2.7 <1.3.0` would match the versions\n`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, and `1.2.99`, but not the versions `1.2.6`, `1.3.0`,\nor `1.1.0`.\n\nThe range `1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0` would match the versions `1.2.7`,\n`1.2.9`, and `1.4.6`, but not the versions `1.2.8` or `2.0.0`.\n\n### Prerelease Tags\n\nIf a version has a prerelease tag (for example, `1.2.3-alpha.3`) then\nit will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one\ncomparator with the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple also has a\nprerelease tag.\n\nFor example, the range `>1.2.3-alpha.3` would be allowed to match the\nversion `1.2.3-alpha.7`, but it would *not* be satisfied by\n`3.4.5-alpha.9`, even though `3.4.5-alpha.9` is technically "greater\nthan" `1.2.3-alpha.3` according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version\nrange only accepts prerelease tags on the `1.2.3` version.  The\nversion `3.4.5` *would* satisfy the range, because it does not have a\nprerelease flag, and `3.4.5` is greater than `1.2.3-alpha.7`.\n\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions\nfrequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes\nthat are (by the author\'s design) not yet fit for public consumption.\nTherefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching\nsemantics.\n\nSecond, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has\nclearly indicated the intent to use *that specific* set of\nalpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,\nthe user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it\nis still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a\nsimilar risk on the *next* set of prerelease versions.\n\n#### Prerelease Identifiers\n\nThe method `.inc` takes an additional `identifier` string argument that\nwill append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:\n\n```javascript\n> semver.inc(\'1.2.3\', \'prerelease\', \'beta\')\n\'1.2.4-beta.0\'\n```\n\ncommand-line example:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta\n1.2.4-beta.0\n```\n\nWhich then can be used to increment further:\n\n```shell\n$ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease\n1.2.4-beta.1\n```\n\n### Advanced Range Syntax\n\nAdvanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in\ndeterministic ways.\n\nAdvanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive\ncomparators using white space or `||`.\n\n#### Hyphen Ranges `X.Y.Z - A.B.C`\n\nSpecifies an inclusive set.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive\nrange, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.\n\n* `1.2 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4`\n\nIf a partial version is provided as the second version in the\ninclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts\nof the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the\nprovided tuple parts.\n\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.4.0`\n* `1.2.3 - 2` := `>=1.2.3 <3.0.0`\n\n#### X-Ranges `1.2.x` `1.X` `1.2.*` `*`\n\nAny of `X`, `x`, or `*` may be used to "stand in" for one of the\nnumeric values in the `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n* `*` := `>=0.0.0` (Any version satisfies)\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Matching major version)\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Matching major and minor versions)\n\nA partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special\ncharacter is in fact optional.\n\n* `""` (empty string) := `*` := `>=0.0.0`\n* `1` := `1.x.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `1.2` := `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`\n\n#### Tilde Ranges `~1.2.3` `~1.2` `~1`\n\nAllows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the\ncomparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.\n\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0` := `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0` (Same as `1.2.x`)\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` (Same as `1.x`)\n* `~0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `~0.2` := `>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0` := `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0` (Same as `0.2.x`)\n* `~0` := `>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` (Same as `0.x`)\n* `~1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n\n#### Caret Ranges `^1.2.3` `^0.2.5` `^0.0.4`\n\nAllows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit in the\n`[major, minor, patch]` tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and\nminor updates for versions `1.0.0` and above, patch updates for\nversions `0.X >=0.1.0`, and *no* updates for versions `0.0.X`.\n\nMany authors treat a `0.x` version as if the `x` were the major\n"breaking-change" indicator.\n\nCaret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes\nbetween `0.2.4` and `0.3.0` releases, which is a common practice.\nHowever, it presumes that there will *not* be breaking changes between\n`0.2.4` and `0.2.5`.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be\nadditive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.\n\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.2.3` := `>=0.2.3 <0.3.0`\n* `^0.0.3` := `>=0.0.3 <0.0.4`\n* `^1.2.3-beta.2` := `>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0` Note that prereleases in\n  the `1.2.3` version will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta.2`.  So, `1.2.3-beta.4` would be allowed, but\n  `1.2.4-beta.2` would not, because it is a prerelease of a\n  different `[major, minor, patch]` tuple.\n* `^0.0.3-beta` := `>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4`  Note that prereleases in the\n  `0.0.3` version *only* will be allowed, if they are greater than or\n  equal to `beta`.  So, `0.0.3-pr.2` would be allowed.\n\nWhen parsing caret ranges, a missing `patch` value desugars to the\nnumber `0`, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the\nmajor and minor versions are both `0`.\n\n* `^1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n* `^0.0` := `>=0.0.0 <0.1.0`\n\nA missing `minor` and `patch` values will desugar to zero, but also\nallow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is\nzero.\n\n* `^1.x` := `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n* `^0.x` := `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n\n### Range Grammar\n\nPutting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,\nfor the benefit of parser authors:\n\n```bnf\nrange-set  ::= range ( logical-or range ) *\nlogical-or ::= ( \' \' ) * \'||\' ( \' \' ) *\nrange      ::= hyphen | simple ( \' \' simple ) * | \'\'\nhyphen     ::= partial \' - \' partial\nsimple     ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret\nprimitive  ::= ( \'<\' | \'>\' | \'>=\' | \'<=\' | \'=\' | ) partial\npartial    ::= xr ( \'.\' xr ( \'.\' xr qualifier ? )? )?\nxr         ::= \'x\' | \'X\' | \'*\' | nr\nnr         ::= \'0\' | [\'1\'-\'9\'] ( [\'0\'-\'9\'] ) *\ntilde      ::= \'~\' partial\ncaret      ::= \'^\' partial\nqualifier  ::= ( \'-\' pre )?

Either `\'auto\'` (default), `\'watch\'` (force native events), or `\'poll\'` (force stat polling).\n  * `cwd` {string} The current working directory to base file patterns from. Default is `process.cwd()`.\n\n#### Events\n\n* `ready(watcher)` When files have been globbed and watching has begun.\n* `all(event, filepath)` When an `added`, `changed` or `deleted` event occurs.\n* `added(filepath)` When a file has been added to a watch directory.\n* `changed(filepath)` When a file has been changed.\n* `deleted(filepath)` When a file has been deleted.\n* `renamed(newPath, oldPath)` When a file has been renamed.\n* `end()` When the watcher is closed and watches have been removed.\n* `error(err)` When an error occurs.\n* `nomatch` When no files have been matched.\n\n#### Methods\n\n* `emit(event, [...])` Wrapper for the EventEmitter.emit.\n  `added`|`changed`|`deleted` events will also trigger the `all` event.\n* `close()` Unwatch all files and reset the watch instance.\n* `add(patterns, callback)` Adds file(s) patterns to be watched.\n* `remove(filepath)` removes a file or directory from being watched. Does not\n  recurse directories.\n* `watched()` Returns the currently watched files.\n* `relative([dir, unixify])` Returns the currently watched files with relative paths.\n  * `dir` {string} Only return relative files for this directory.\n  * `unixify` {boolean} Return paths with `/` instead of `\\\\` if on Windows.\n\n## Similar Projects\n\nOther great watch libraries to try are:\n\n* [paulmillr\'s chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)\n* [amasad\'s sane](https://github.com/amasad/sane)\n* [mikeal\'s watch](https://github.com/mikeal/watch)\n* [github\'s pathwatcher](https://github.com/atom/node-pathwatcher)\n* [bevry\'s watchr](https://github.com/bevry/watchr)\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.\nAdd unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code\nusing [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## Release History\n* 1.1.1 - Prevent fs.watch errors from escaping error handler (@rosen-vladimirov). Fix _addToWatched without path.sep (@wyicwx).\n* 1.1.0 - Update to `globule@1.0.0` with `minimatch >= 3.0.0`.\n* 1.0.0 - Revert back to 0.5.2. Drop support for Node.js v0.8. Fix for `maxListeners`. Update globule to `0.2.0`.\n* 0.6.4 - Catch and emit error from readdir (@oconnore). Fix for 0 maxListeners. Use graceful-fs to avoid EMFILE errors in other places fs is used. Better method to determine if pathwatcher was built. Fix keeping process alive too much, only init pathwatcher if a file is being watched. Set min required to Windows Vista when building on Windows (@pvolok).\n* 0.6.3 - Add support for node v0.11\n* 0.6.2 - Fix argument error with watched(). Fix for erroneous added events on folders. Ignore msvs build error 4244.\n* 0.6.1 - Fix for absolute paths.\n* 0.6.0 - Uses native OS events (fork of pathwatcher) but can fall back to stat polling. Everything is async to avoid blocking, including `relative()` and `watched()`. Better error handling. Update to globule@0.2.0. No longer watches `cwd` by default. Added `mode` option. Better `EMFILE` message. Avoids `ENOENT` errors with symlinks. All constructor arguments are optional.\n* 0.5.2 - Fix for ENOENT error with non-existent symlinks [BACKPORTED].\n* 0.5.1 - Use setImmediate (process.nextTick for node v0.8) to defer ready/nomatch events (@amasad).\n* 0.5.0 - Process is now kept alive while watching files. Emits a nomatch event when no files are matching.\n* 0.4.3 - Track file additions in newly created folders (@brett-shwom).\n* 0.4.2 - Fix .remove() method to remove a single file in a directory (@kaelzhang). Fixing Cannot call method \'call\' of undefined (@krasimir). Track new file additions within folders (@brett-shwom).\n* 0.4.1 - Fix watchDir not respecting close in race condition (@chrisirhc).\n* 0.4.0 - Drop support for node v0.6. Use globule for file matching. Avoid node v0.10 path.resolve/join errors. Register new files when added to non-existent folder. Multiple instances can now poll the same files (@jpommerening).\n* 0.3.4 - Code clean up. Fix path must be strings errors (@groner). Fix incorrect added events (@groner).\n* 0.3.3 - Fix for multiple patterns with negate.\n* 0.3.2 - Emit `end` before removeAllListeners.\n* 0.3.1 - Fix added events within subfolder patterns.\n* 0.3.0 - Handle safewrite events, `forceWatchMethod` option removed, bug fixes and watch optimizations (@rgaskill).\n* 0.2.2 - Fix issue where subsequent add calls dont get watched (@samcday). removeAllListeners on close.\n* 0.2.1 - Fix issue with invalid `added` events in current working dir.\n* 0.2.0 - Support and mark folders with `path.sep`. Add `forceWatchMethod` option. Support `renamed` events.\n* 0.1.6 - Recognize the `cwd` option properly\n* 0.1.5 - Catch too many open file errors\n* 0.1.4 - Really fix the race condition with 2 watches\n* 0.1.3 - Fix race condition with 2 watches\n* 0.1.2 - Read triggering changed event fix\n* 0.1.1 - Minor fixes\n* 0.1.0 - Initial release\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2015 Kyle Robinson Young  \nLicensed under the MIT license.\n',

Otherwise it becomes a noop.\n* ignores `EINVAL` and `EPERM` errors in `chown`, `fchown` or\n  `lchown` if the user isn\'t root.\n* makes `lchmod` and `lchown` become noops, if not available.\n* retries reading a file if `read` results in EAGAIN error.\n\nOn Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if `EACCESS`\nor `EPERM` error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked\nthe directory.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```javascript\n// use just like fs\nvar fs = require(\'graceful-fs\')\n\n// now go and do stuff with it...\nfs.readFileSync(\'some-file-or-whatever\')\n```\n\n## Global Patching\n\nIf you want to patch the global fs module (or any other fs-like\nmodule) you can do this:\n\n```javascript\n// Make sure to read the caveat below.\nvar realFs = require(\'fs\')\nvar gracefulFs = require(\'graceful-fs\')\ngracefulFs.gracefulify(realFs)\n```\n\nThis should only ever be done at the top-level application layer, in\norder to delay on EMFILE errors from any fs-using dependencies.  You\nshould **not** do this in a library, because it can cause unexpected\ndelays in other parts of the program.\n\n## Changes\n\nThis module is fairly stable at this point, and used by a lot of\nthings.  That being said, because it implements a subtle behavior\nchange in a core part of the node API, even modest changes can be\nextremely breaking, and the versioning is thus biased towards\nbumping the major when in doubt.\n\nThe main change between major versions has been switching between\nproviding a fully-patched `fs` module vs monkey-patching the node core\nbuiltin, and the approach by which a non-monkey-patched `fs` was\ncreated.\n\nThe goal is to trade `EMFILE` errors for slower fs operations.  So, if\nyou try to open a zillion files, rather than crashing, `open`\noperations will be queued up and wait for something else to `close`.\n\nThere are advantages to each approach.  Monkey-patching the fs means\nthat no `EMFILE` errors can possibly occur anywhere in your\napplication, because everything is using the same core `fs` module,\nwhich is patched.  However, it can also obviously cause undesirable\nside-effects, especially if the module is loaded multiple times.\n\nImplementing a separate-but-identical patched `fs` module is more\nsurgical (and doesn\'t run the risk of patching multiple times), but\nalso imposes the challenge of keeping in sync with the core module.\n\nThe current approach loads the `fs` module, and then creates a\nlookalike object that has all the same methods, except a few that are\npatched.  It is safe to use in all versions of Node from 0.8 through\n7.0.\n\n### v4\n\n* Do not monkey-patch the fs module.  This module may now be used as a\n  drop-in dep, and users can opt into monkey-patching the fs builtin\n  if their app requires it.\n\n### v3\n\n* Monkey-patch fs, because the eval approach no longer works on recent\n  node.\n* fixed possible type-error throw if rename fails on windows\n* verify that we *never* get EMFILE errors\n* Ignore ENOSYS from chmod/chown\n* clarify that graceful-fs must be used as a drop-in\n\n### v2.1.0\n\n* Use eval rather than monkey-patching fs.\n* readdir: Always sort the results\n* win32: requeue a file if error has an OK status\n\n### v2.0\n\n* A return to monkey patching\n* wrap process.cwd\n\n### v1.1\n\n* wrap readFile\n* Wrap fs.writeFile.\n* readdir protection\n* Don\'t clobber the fs builtin\n* Handle fs.read EAGAIN errors by trying again\n* Expose the curOpen counter\n* No-op lchown/lchmod if not implemented\n* fs.rename patch only for win32\n* Patch fs.rename to handle AV software on Windows\n* Close #4 Chown should not fail on einval or eperm if non-root\n* Fix isaacs/fstream#1 Only wrap fs one time\n* Fix #3 Start at 1024 max files, then back off on EMFILE\n* lutimes that doens\'t blow up on Linux\n* A full on-rewrite using a queue instead of just swallowing the EMFILE error\n* Wrap Read/Write streams as well\n\n### 1.0\n\n* Update engines for node 0.6\n* Be lstat-graceful on Windows\n* first\n',

190630 silly resolved     readme: '# graceful-fs\n\ngraceful-fs functions as a drop-in replacement for the fs module,\nmaking various improvements.\n\nThe improvements are meant to normalize behavior across different\nplatforms and environments, and to make filesystem access more\nresilient to errors.\n\n## Improvements over [fs module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)\n\n* Queues up `open` and `readdir` calls, and retries them once\n  something closes if there is an EMFILE error from too many file\n  descriptors.\n* fixes `lchmod` for Node versions prior to 0.6.2.\n* implements `fs.lutimes` if possible. Otherwise it becomes a noop.\n* ignores `EINVAL` and `EPERM` errors in `chown`, `fchown` or\n  `lchown` if the user isn\'t root.\n* makes `lchmod` and `lchown` become noops, if not available.\n* retries reading a file if `read` results in EAGAIN error.\n\nOn Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if `EACCESS`\nor `EPERM` error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked\nthe directory.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```javascript\n// use just like fs\nvar fs = require(\'graceful-fs\')\n\n// now go and do stuff with it...\nfs.readFileSync(\'some-file-or-whatever\')\n```\n\n## Global Patching\n\nIf you want to patch the global fs module (or any other fs-like\nmodule) you can do this:\n\n```javascript\n// Make sure to read the caveat below.\nvar realFs = require(\'fs\')\nvar gracefulFs = require(\'graceful-fs\')\ngracefulFs.gracefulify(realFs)\n```\n\nThis should only ever be done at the top-level application layer, in\norder to delay on EMFILE errors from any fs-using dependencies.  You\nshould **not** do this in a library, because it can cause unexpected\ndelays in other parts of the program.\n\n## Changes\n\nThis module is fairly stable at this point, and used by a lot of\nthings.  That being said, because it implements a subtle behavior\nchange in a core part of the node API, even modest changes can be\nextremely breaking, and the versioning is thus biased towards\nbumping the major when in doubt.\n\nThe main change between major versions has been switching between\nproviding a fully-patched `fs` module vs monkey-patching the node core\nbuiltin, and the approach by which a non-monkey-patched `fs` was\ncreated.\n\nThe goal is to trade `EMFILE` errors for slower fs operations.  So, if\nyou try to open a zillion files, rather than crashing, `open`\noperations will be queued up and wait for something else to `close`.\n\nThere are advantages to each approach.  Monkey-patching the fs means\nthat no `EMFILE` errors can possibly occur anywhere in your\napplication, because everything is using the same core `fs` module,\nwhich is patched.  However, it can also obviously cause undesirable\nside-effects, especially if the module is loaded multiple times.\n\nImplementing a separate-but-identical patched `fs` module is more\nsurgical (and doesn\'t run the risk of patching multiple times), but\nalso imposes the challenge of keeping in sync with the core module.\n\nThe current approach loads the `fs` module, and then creates a\nlookalike object that has all the same methods, except a few that are\npatched.  It is safe to use in all versions of Node from 0.8 through\n7.0.\n\n### v4\n\n* Do not monkey-patch the fs module.  This module may now be used as a\n  drop-in dep, and users can opt into monkey-patching the fs builtin\n  if their app requires it.\n\n### v3\n\n* Monkey-patch fs, because the eval approach no longer works on recent\n  node.\n* fixed possible type-error throw if rename fails on windows\n* verify that we *never* get EMFILE errors\n* Ignore ENOSYS from chmod/chown\n* clarify that graceful-fs must be used as a drop-in\n\n### v2.1.0\n\n* Use eval rather than monkey-patching fs.\n* readdir: Always sort the results\n* win32: requeue a file if error has an OK status\n\n### v2.0\n\n* A return to monkey patching\n* wrap process.cwd\n\n### v1.1\n\n* wrap readFile\n* Wrap fs.writeFile.\n* readdir protection\n* Don\'t clobber the fs builtin\n* Handle fs.read EAGAIN errors by trying again\n* Expose the curOpen counter\n* No-op lchown/lchmod if not implemented\n* fs.rename patch only for win32\n* Patch fs.rename to handle AV software on Windows\n* Close #4 Chown should not fail on einval or eperm if non-root\n* Fix isaacs/fstream#1 Only wrap fs one time\n* Fix #3 Start at 1024 max files, then back off on EMFILE\n* lutimes that doens\'t blow up on Linux\n* A full on-rewrite using a queue instead of just swallowing the EMFILE error\n* Wrap Read/Write streams as well\n\n### 1.0\n\n* Update engines for node 0.6\n* Be lstat-graceful on Windows\n* first\n',

That being said, because it implements a subtle behavior\nchange in a core part of the node API, even modest changes can be\nextremely breaking, and the versioning is thus biased towards\nbumping the major when in doubt.\n\nThe main change between major versions has been switching between\nproviding a fully-patched `fs` module vs monkey-patching the node core\nbuiltin, and the approach by which a non-monkey-patched `fs` was\ncreated.\n\nThe goal is to trade `EMFILE` errors for slower fs operations.  So, if\nyou try to open a zillion files, rather than crashing, `open`\noperations will be queued up and wait for something else to `close`.\n\nThere are advantages to each approach.  Monkey-patching the fs means\nthat no `EMFILE` errors can possibly occur anywhere in your\napplication, because everything is using the same core `fs` module,\nwhich is patched.  However, it can also obviously cause undesirable\nside-effects, especially if the module is loaded multiple times.\n\nImplementing a separate-but-identical patched `fs` module is more\nsurgical (and doesn\'t run the risk of patching multiple times), but\nalso imposes the challenge of keeping in sync with the core module.\n\nThe current approach loads the `fs` module, and then creates a\nlookalike object that has all the same methods, except a few that are\npatched.

190660 silly resolved     readme: '# graceful-fs\n\ngraceful-fs functions as a drop-in replacement for the fs module,\nmaking various improvements.\n\nThe improvements are meant to normalize behavior across different\nplatforms and environments, and to make filesystem access more\nresilient to errors.\n\n## Improvements over [fs module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)\n\n* Queues up `open` and `readdir` calls, and retries them once\n  something closes if there is an EMFILE error from too many file\n  descriptors.\n* fixes `lchmod` for Node versions prior to 0.6.2.\n* implements `fs.lutimes` if possible. Otherwise it becomes a noop.\n* ignores `EINVAL` and `EPERM` errors in `chown`, `fchown` or\n  `lchown` if the user isn\'t root.\n* makes `lchmod` and `lchown` become noops, if not available.\n* retries reading a file if `read` results in EAGAIN error.\n\nOn Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if `EACCESS`\nor `EPERM` error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked\nthe directory.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```javascript\n// use just like fs\nvar fs = require(\'graceful-fs\')\n\n// now go and do stuff with it...\nfs.readFileSync(\'some-file-or-whatever\')\n```\n\n## Global Patching\n\nIf you want to patch the global fs module (or any other fs-like\nmodule) you can do this:\n\n```javascript\n// Make sure to read the caveat below.\nvar realFs = require(\'fs\')\nvar gracefulFs = require(\'graceful-fs\')\ngracefulFs.gracefulify(realFs)\n```\n\nThis should only ever be done at the top-level application layer, in\norder to delay on EMFILE errors from any fs-using dependencies.  You\nshould **not** do this in a library, because it can cause unexpected\ndelays in other parts of the program.\n\n## Changes\n\nThis module is fairly stable at this point, and used by a lot of\nthings.  That being said, because it implements a subtle behavior\nchange in a core part of the node API, even modest changes can be\nextremely breaking, and the versioning is thus biased towards\nbumping the major when in doubt.\n\nThe main change between major versions has been switching between\nproviding a fully-patched `fs` module vs monkey-patching the node core\nbuiltin, and the approach by which a non-monkey-patched `fs` was\ncreated.\n\nThe goal is to trade `EMFILE` errors for slower fs operations.  So, if\nyou try to open a zillion files, rather than crashing, `open`\noperations will be queued up and wait for something else to `close`.\n\nThere are advantages to each approach.  Monkey-patching the fs means\nthat no `EMFILE` errors can possibly occur anywhere in your\napplication, because everything is using the same core `fs` module,\nwhich is patched.  However, it can also obviously cause undesirable\nside-effects, especially if the module is loaded multiple times.\n\nImplementing a separate-but-identical patched `fs` module is more\nsurgical (and doesn\'t run the risk of patching multiple times), but\nalso imposes the challenge of keeping in sync with the core module.\n\nThe current approach loads the `fs` module, and then creates a\nlookalike object that has all the same methods, except a few that are\npatched.  It is safe to use in all versions of Node from 0.8 through\n7.0.\n\n### v4\n\n* Do not monkey-patch the fs module.  This module may now be used as a\n  drop-in dep, and users can opt into monkey-patching the fs builtin\n  if their app requires it.\n\n### v3\n\n* Monkey-patch fs, because the eval approach no longer works on recent\n  node.\n* fixed possible type-error throw if rename fails on windows\n* verify that we *never* get EMFILE errors\n* Ignore ENOSYS from chmod/chown\n* clarify that graceful-fs must be used as a drop-in\n\n### v2.1.0\n\n* Use eval rather than monkey-patching fs.\n* readdir: Always sort the results\n* win32: requeue a file if error has an OK status\n\n### v2.0\n\n* A return to monkey patching\n* wrap process.cwd\n\n### v1.1\n\n* wrap readFile\n* Wrap fs.writeFile.\n* readdir protection\n* Don\'t clobber the fs builtin\n* Handle fs.read EAGAIN errors by trying again\n* Expose the curOpen counter\n* No-op lchown/lchmod if not implemented\n* fs.rename patch only for win32\n* Patch fs.rename to handle AV software on Windows\n* Close #4 Chown should not fail on einval or eperm if non-root\n* Fix isaacs/fstream#1 Only wrap fs one time\n* Fix #3 Start at 1024 max files, then back off on EMFILE\n* lutimes that doens\'t blow up on Linux\n* A full on-rewrite using a queue instead of just swallowing the EMFILE error\n* Wrap Read/Write streams as well\n\n### 1.0\n\n* Update engines for node 0.6\n* Be lstat-graceful on Windows\n* first\n',

You\nshould **not** do this in a library, because it can cause unexpected\ndelays in other parts of the program.\n\n## Changes\n\nThis module is fairly stable at this point, and used by a lot of\nthings.  That being said, because it implements a subtle behavior\nchange in a core part of the node API, even modest changes can be\nextremely breaking, and the versioning is thus biased towards\nbumping the major when in doubt.\n\nThe main change between major versions has been switching between\nproviding a fully-patched `fs` module vs monkey-patching the node core\nbuiltin, and the approach by which a non-monkey-patched `fs` was\ncreated.\n\nThe goal is to trade `EMFILE` errors for slower fs operations.  So, if\nyou try to open a zillion files, rather than crashing, `open`\noperations will be queued up and wait for something else to `close`.\n\nThere are advantages to each approach.  Monkey-patching the fs means\nthat no `EMFILE` errors can possibly occur anywhere in your\napplication, because everything is using the same core `fs` module,\nwhich is patched.  However, it can also obviously cause undesirable\nside-effects, especially if the module is loaded multiple times.\n\nImplementing a separate-but-identical patched `fs` module is more\nsurgical (and doesn\'t run the risk of patching multiple times), but\nalso imposes the challenge of keeping in sync with the core module.\n\nThe current approach loads the `fs` module, and then creates a\nlookalike object that has all the same methods, except a few that are\npatched.  It is safe to use in all versions of Node from 0.8 through\n7.0.\n\n### v4\n\n* Do not monkey-patch the fs module.  This module may now be used as a\n  drop-in dep, and users can opt into monkey-patching the fs builtin\n  if their app requires it.\n\n### v3\n\n* Monkey-patch fs, because the eval approach no longer works on recent\n  node.\n* fixed possible type-error throw if rename fails on windows\n* verify that we *never* get EMFILE errors\n* Ignore ENOSYS from chmod/chown\n* clarify that graceful-fs must be used as a drop-in\n\n### v2.1.0\n\n* Use eval rather than monkey-patching fs.\n* readdir: Always sort the results\n* win32: requeue a file if error has an OK status\n\n### v2.0\n\n* A return to monkey patching\n* wrap process.cwd\n\n### v1.1\n\n* wrap readFile\n* Wrap fs.writeFile.\n* readdir protection\n* Don\'t clobber the fs builtin\n* Handle fs.read EAGAIN errors by trying again\n* Expose the curOpen counter\n* No-op lchown/lchmod if not implemented\n* fs.rename patch only for win32\n* Patch fs.rename to handle AV software on Windows\n* Close #4 Chown should not fail on einval or eperm if non-root\n* Fix isaacs/fstream#1 Only wrap fs one time\n* Fix #3 Start at 1024 max files, then back off on EMFILE\n* lutimes that doens\'t blow up on Linux\n* A full on-rewrite using a queue instead of just swallowing the EMFILE error\n* Wrap Read/Write streams as well\n\n### 1.0\n\n* Update engines for node 0.6\n* Be lstat-graceful on Windows\n* first\n',

190821 silly resolved     readme: '# process\n\n```require(\'process\');``` just like any other module.\n\nWorks in node.js and browsers via the browser.js shim provided with the module.\n\n## browser implementation\n\nThe goal of this module is not to be a full-fledged alternative to the builtin process module. This module mostly exists to provide the nextTick functionality and little more. We keep this module lean because it will often be included by default by tools like browserify when it detects a module has used the `process` global.\n\nIt also exposes a "browser" member (i.e. `process.browser`) which is `true` in this implementation but `undefined` in node. This can be used in isomorphic code that adjusts it\'s behavior depending on which environment it\'s running in. \n\nIf you are looking to provide other process methods, I suggest you monkey patch them onto the process global in your app. A list of user created patches is below.\n\n* [hrtime](https://github.com/kumavis/browser-process-hrtime)\n* [stdout](https://github.com/kumavis/browser-stdout)\n\n## package manager notes\n\nIf you are writing a bundler to package modules for client side use, make sure you use the ```browser``` field hint in package.json.\n\nSee https://gist.github.com/4339901 for details.\n\nThe [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) module will properly handle this field when bundling your files.\n\n\n',

191522 silly resolved     readme: '# osenv\n\nLook up environment settings specific to different operating systems.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar osenv = require(\'osenv\')\nvar path = osenv.path()\nvar user = osenv.user()\n// etc.\n\n// Some things are not reliably in the env, and have a fallback command:\nvar h = osenv.hostname(function (er, hostname) {\n  h = hostname\n})\n// This will still cause it to be memoized, so calling osenv.hostname()\n// is now an immediate operation.\n\n// You can always send a cb, which will get called in the nextTick\n// if it\'s been memoized, or wait for the fallback data if it wasn\'t\n// found in the environment.\nosenv.hostname(function (er, hostname) {\n  if (er) console.error(\'error looking up hostname\')\n  else console.log(\'this machine calls itself %s\', hostname)\n})\n```\n\n## osenv.hostname()\n\nThe machine name.  Calls `hostname` if not found.\n\n## osenv.user()\n\nThe currently logged-in user.  Calls `whoami` if not found.\n\n## osenv.prompt()\n\nEither PS1 on unix, or PROMPT on Windows.\n\n## osenv.tmpdir()\n\nThe place where temporary files should be created.\n\n## osenv.home()\n\nNo place like it.\n\n## osenv.path()\n\nAn array of the places that the operating system will search for\nexecutables.\n\n## osenv.editor() \n\nReturn the executable name of the editor program.  This uses the EDITOR\nand VISUAL environment variables, and falls back to `vi` on Unix, or\n`notepad.exe` on Windows.\n\n## osenv.shell()\n\nThe SHELL on Unix, which Windows calls the ComSpec.  Defaults to \'bash\'\nor \'cmd\'.\n',

It uses the `minimatch`\nlibrary to do its matching.\n\n![](oh-my-glob.gif)\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar glob = require("glob")\n\n// options is optional\nglob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {\n  // files is an array of filenames.\n  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing\n  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]\n  // er is an error object or null.\n})\n```\n\n## Glob Primer\n\n"Globs" are the patterns you type when you do stuff like `ls *.js` on\nthe command line, or put `build/*` in a `.gitignore` file.\n\nBefore parsing the path part patterns, braced sections are expanded\ninto a set.  Braced sections start with `{` and end with `}`, with any\nnumber of comma-delimited sections within.  Braced sections may contain\nslash characters, so `a{/b/c,bcd}` would expand into `a/b/c` and `abcd`.\n\nThe following characters have special magic meaning when used in a\npath portion:\n\n* `*` Matches 0 or more characters in a single path portion\n* `?` Matches 1 character\n* `[...]` Matches a range of characters, similar to a RegExp range.\n  If the first character of the range is `!` or `^` then it matches\n  any character not in the range.\n* `!(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches anything that does not match\n  any of the patterns provided.\n* `?(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches zero or one occurrence of the\n  patterns provided.\n* `+(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches one or more occurrences of the\n  patterns provided.\n* `*(a|b|c)` Matches zero or more occurrences of the patterns provided\n* `@(pattern|pat*|pat?erN)` Matches exactly one of the patterns\n  provided\n* `**` If a "globstar" is alone in a path portion, then it matches\n  zero or more directories and subdirectories searching for matches.\n  It does not crawl symlinked directories.\n\n### Dots\n\nIf a file or directory path portion has a `.` as the first character,\nthen it will not match any glob pattern unless that pattern\'s\ncorresponding path part also has a `.` as its first character.\n\nFor example, the pattern `a/.*/c` would match the file at `a/.b/c`.\nHowever the pattern `a/*/c` would not, because `*` does not start with\na dot character.\n\nYou can make glob treat dots as normal characters by setting\n`dot:true` in the options.\n\n### Basename Matching\n\nIf you set `matchBase:true` in the options, and the pattern has no\nslashes in it, then it will seek for any file anywhere in the tree\nwith a matching basename.  For example, `*.js` would match\n`test/simple/basic.js`.\n\n### Negation\n\nThe intent for negation would be for a pattern starting with `!` to\nmatch everything that *doesn\'t* match the supplied pattern.  However,\nthe implementation is weird, and for the time being, this should be\navoided.  The behavior will change or be deprecated in version 5.\n\n### Empty Sets\n\nIf no matching files are found, then an empty array is returned.  This\ndiffers from the shell, where the pattern itself is returned.  For\nexample:\n\n    $ echo a*s*d*f\n    a*s*d*f\n\nTo get the bash-style behavior, set the `nonull:true` in the options.\n\n### See Also:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash` (Search for "Pattern Matching")\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n## glob.hasMagic(pattern, [options])\n\nReturns `true` if there are any special characters in the pattern, and\n`false` otherwise.\n\nNote that the options affect the results.  If `noext:true` is set in\nthe options object, then `+(a|b)` will not be considered a magic\npattern.  If the pattern has a brace expansion, like `a/{b/c,x/y}`\nthen that is considered magical, unless `nobrace:true` is set in the\noptions.\n\n## glob(pattern, [options], cb)\n\n* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched\n* `options` {Object}\n* `cb` {Function}\n  * `err` {Error | null}\n  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nPerform an asynchronous glob search.\n\n## glob.sync(pattern, [options])\n\n* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched\n* `options` {Object}\n* return: {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nPerform a synchronous glob search.\n\n## Class: glob.Glob\n\nCreate a Glob object by instantiating the `glob.Glob` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Glob = require("glob").Glob\nvar mg = new Glob(pattern, options, cb)\n```\n\nIt\'s an EventEmitter, and starts walking the filesystem to find matches\nimmediately.\n\n### new glob.Glob(pattern, [options], [cb])\n\n* `pattern` {String} pattern to search for\n* `options` {Object}\n* `cb` {Function} Called when an error occurs, or matches are found\n  * `err` {Error | null}\n  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nNote that if the `sync` flag is set in the options, then matches will\nbe immediately available on the `g.found` member.\n\n### Properties\n\n* `minimatch` The minimatch object that the glob uses.\n* `options` The options object passed in.\n* `aborted` Boolean which is set to true when calling `abort()`.  There\n  is no way at this time to continue a glob search after aborting, but\n  you can re-use the statCache to avoid having to duplicate syscalls.\n* `statCache` Collection of all the stat results the glob search\n  performed.\n* `cache` Convenience object.  Each field has the following possible\n  values:\n  * `false` - Path does not exist\n  * `true` - Path exists\n  * `\'DIR\'` - Path exists, and is not a directory\n  * `\'FILE\'` - Path exists, and is a directory\n  * `[file, entries, ...]` - Path exists, is a directory, and the\n    array value is the results of `fs.readdir`\n* `statCache` Cache of `fs.stat` results, to prevent statting the same\n  path multiple times.\n* `symlinks` A record of which paths are symbolic links, which is\n  relevant in resolving `**` patterns.\n* `realpathCache` An optional object which is passed to `fs.realpath`\n  to minimize unnecessary syscalls.  It is stored on the instantiated\n  Glob object, and may be re-used.\n\n### Events\n\n* `end` When the matching is finished, this is emitted with all the\n  matches found.  If the `nonull` option is set, and no match was found,\n  then the `matches` list contains the original pattern.  The matches\n  are sorted, unless the `nosort` flag is set.\n* `match` Every time a match is found, this is emitted with the matched.\n* `error` Emitted when an unexpected error is encountered, or whenever\n  any fs error occurs if `options.strict` is set.\n* `abort` When `abort()` is called, this event is raised.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `pause` Temporarily stop the search\n* `resume` Resume the search\n* `abort` Stop the search forever\n\n### Options\n\nAll the options that can be passed to Minimatch can also be passed to\nGlob to change pattern matching behavior.  Also, some have been added,\nor have glob-specific ramifications.\n\nAll options are false by default, unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll options are added to the Glob object, as well.\n\nIf you are running many `glob` operations, you can pass a Glob object\nas the `options` argument to a subsequent operation to shortcut some\n`stat` and `readdir` calls.  At the very least, you may pass in shared\n`symlinks`, `statCache`, `realpathCache`, and `cache` options, so that\nparallel glob operations will be sped up by sharing information about\nthe filesystem.\n\n* `cwd` The current working directory in which to search.  Defaults\n  to `process.cwd()`.\n* `root` The place where patterns starting with `/` will be mounted\n  onto.  Defaults to `path.resolve(options.cwd, "/")` (`/` on Unix\n  systems, and `C:\\` or some such on Windows.)\n* `dot` Include `.dot` files in normal matches and `globstar` matches.\n  Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern will always\n  match dot files.\n* `nomount` By default, a pattern starting with a forward-slash will be\n  "mounted" onto the root setting, so that a valid filesystem path is\n  returned.  Set this flag to disable that behavior.\n* `mark` Add a `/` character to directory matches.  Note that this\n  requires additional stat calls.\n* `nosort` Don\'t sort the results.\n* `stat` Set to true to stat *all* results.  This reduces performance\n  somewhat, and is completely unnecessary, unless `readdir` is presumed\n  to be an untrustworthy indicator of file existence.\n* `silent` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to\n  read a directory, a warning will be printed to stderr.  Set the\n  `silent` option to true to suppress these warnings.\n* `strict` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to\n  read a directory, the process will just continue on in search of\n  other matches.  Set the `strict` option to raise an error in these\n  cases.\n* `cache` See `cache` property above.  Pass in a previously generated\n  cache object to save some fs calls.\n* `statCache` A cache of results of filesystem information, to prevent\n  unnecessary stat calls.  While it should not normally be necessary\n  to set this, you may pass the statCache from one glob() call to the\n  options object of another, if you know that the filesystem will not\n  change between calls.  (See "Race Conditions" below.)\n* `symlinks` A cache of known symbolic links.  You may pass in a\n  previously generated `symlinks` object to save `lstat` calls when\n  resolving `**` matches.\n* `sync` DEPRECATED: use `glob.sync(pattern, opts)` instead.\n* `nounique` In some cases, brace-expanded patterns can result in the\n  same file showing up multiple times in the result set.  By default,\n  this implementation prevents duplicates in the result set.  Set this\n  flag to disable that behavior.\n* `nonull` Set to never return an empty set, instead returning a set\n  containing the pattern itself.  This is the default in glob(3).\n* `debug` Set to enable debug logging in minimatch and glob.\n* `nobrace` Do not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.\n* `noglobstar` Do not match `**` against multiple filenames.  (Ie,\n  treat it as a normal `*` instead.)\n* `noext` Do not match `+(a|b)` "extglob" patterns.\n* `nocase` Perform a case-insensitive match.  Note: on\n  case-insensitive filesystems, non-magic patterns will match by\n  default, since `stat` and `readdir` will not raise errors.\n* `matchBase` Perform a basename-only match if the pattern does not\n  contain any slash characters.  That is, `*.js` would be treated as\n  equivalent to `**/*.js`, matching all js files in all directories.\n* `nonegate` Suppress `negate` behavior.  (See below.)\n* `nocomment` Suppress `comment` behavior.  (See below.)\n* `nonull` Return the pattern when no matches are found.\n* `nodir` Do not match directories, only files.  (Note: to match\n  *only* directories, simply put a `/` at the end of the pattern.)\n* `ignore` Add a pattern or an array of patterns to exclude matches.\n* `follow` Follow symlinked directories when expanding `**` patterns.\n  Note that this can result in a lot of duplicate references in the\n  presence of cyclic links.\n* `realpath` Set to true to call `fs.realpath` on all of the results.\n  In the case of a symlink that cannot be resolved, the full absolute\n  path to the matched entry is returned (though it will usually be a\n  broken symlink)\n\n## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations\n\nWhile strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile\ngoal, some discrepancies exist between node-glob and other\nimplementations, and are intentional.\n\nIf the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the\n`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`\ncharacters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the\npattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`\ncharacters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple\ntimes.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and\nwill not match anything.  Use `\\#` to match a literal `#` at the\nstart of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.\n\nThe double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the\n`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob\nand bash 4.3, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only\nthing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but\n`a/**b` will not.\n\nNote that symlinked directories are not crawled as part of a `**`,\nthough their contents may match against subsequent portions of the\npattern.  This prevents infinite loops and duplicates and the like.\n\nIf an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,\nthen glob returns the pattern as-provided, rather than\ninterpreting the character escapes.  For example,\n`glob.match([], "\\\\*a\\\\?")` will return `"\\\\*a\\\\?"` rather than\n`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except\nthat it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\n\nIf brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any\nother interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like\n`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded\n**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are\nchecked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.\n\n## Windows\n\n**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**\n\nThough windows uses either `/` or `\\` as its path separator, only `/`\ncharacters are used by this glob implementation.  You must use\nforward-slashes **only** in glob expressions.  Back-slashes will always\nbe interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.\n\nResults from absolute patterns such as `/foo/*` are mounted onto the\nroot setting using `path.join`.  On windows, this will by default result\nin `/foo/*` matching `C:\\foo\\bar.txt`.\n\n## Race Conditions\n\nGlob searching, by its very nature, is susceptible to race conditions,\nsince it relies on directory walking and such.\n\nAs a result, it is possible that a file that exists when glob looks for\nit may have been deleted or modified by the time it returns the result.\n\nAs part of its internal implementation, this program caches all stat\nand readdir calls that it makes, in order to cut down on system\noverhead.  However, this also makes it even more susceptible to races,\nespecially if the cache or statCache objects are reused between glob\ncalls.\n\nUsers are thus advised not to use a glob result as a guarantee of\nfilesystem state in the face of rapid changes.  For the vast majority\nof operations, this is never a problem.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny change to behavior (including bugfixes) must come with a test.\n\nPatches that fail tests or reduce performance will be rejected.\n\n```\n# to run tests\nnpm test\n\n# to re-generate test fixtures\nnpm run test-regen\n\n# to benchmark against bash/zsh\nnpm run bench\n\n# to profile javascript\nnpm run prof\n```\n',

For\nexample:\n\n    $ echo a*s*d*f\n    a*s*d*f\n\nTo get the bash-style behavior, set the `nonull:true` in the options.\n\n### See Also:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash` (Search for "Pattern Matching")\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n## glob.hasMagic(pattern, [options])\n\nReturns `true` if there are any special characters in the pattern, and\n`false` otherwise.\n\nNote that the options affect the results.  If `noext:true` is set in\nthe options object, then `+(a|b)` will not be considered a magic\npattern.  If the pattern has a brace expansion, like `a/{b/c,x/y}`\nthen that is considered magical, unless `nobrace:true` is set in the\noptions.\n\n## glob(pattern, [options], cb)\n\n* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched\n* `options` {Object}\n* `cb` {Function}\n  * `err` {Error | null}\n  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nPerform an asynchronous glob search.\n\n## glob.sync(pattern, [options])\n\n* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched\n* `options` {Object}\n* return: {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nPerform a synchronous glob search.\n\n## Class: glob.Glob\n\nCreate a Glob object by instantiating the `glob.Glob` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Glob = require("glob").Glob\nvar mg = new Glob(pattern, options, cb)\n```\n\nIt\'s an EventEmitter, and starts walking the filesystem to find matches\nimmediately.\n\n### new glob.Glob(pattern, [options], [cb])\n\n* `pattern` {String} pattern to search for\n* `options` {Object}\n* `cb` {Function} Called when an error occurs, or matches are found\n  * `err` {Error | null}\n  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nNote that if the `sync` flag is set in the options, then matches will\nbe immediately available on the `g.found` member.\n\n### Properties\n\n* `minimatch` The minimatch object that the glob uses.\n* `options` The options object passed in.\n* `aborted` Boolean which is set to true when calling `abort()`.  There\n  is no way at this time to continue a glob search after aborting, but\n  you can re-use the statCache to avoid having to duplicate syscalls.\n* `statCache` Collection of all the stat results the glob search\n  performed.\n* `cache` Convenience object.  Each field has the following possible\n  values:\n  * `false` - Path does not exist\n  * `true` - Path exists\n  * `\'DIR\'` - Path exists, and is not a directory\n  * `\'FILE\'` - Path exists, and is a directory\n  * `[file, entries, ...]` - Path exists, is a directory, and the\n    array value is the results of `fs.readdir`\n* `statCache` Cache of `fs.stat` results, to prevent statting the same\n  path multiple times.\n* `symlinks` A record of which paths are symbolic links, which is\n  relevant in resolving `**` patterns.\n* `realpathCache` An optional object which is passed to `fs.realpath`\n  to minimize unnecessary syscalls.  It is stored on the instantiated\n  Glob object, and may be re-used.\n\n### Events\n\n* `end` When the matching is finished, this is emitted with all the\n  matches found.  If the `nonull` option is set, and no match was found,\n  then the `matches` list contains the original pattern.  The matches\n  are sorted, unless the `nosort` flag is set.\n* `match` Every time a match is found, this is emitted with the matched.\n* `error` Emitted when an unexpected error is encountered, or whenever\n  any fs error occurs if `options.strict` is set.\n* `abort` When `abort()` is called, this event is raised.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `pause` Temporarily stop the search\n* `resume` Resume the search\n* `abort` Stop the search forever\n\n### Options\n\nAll the options that can be passed to Minimatch can also be passed to\nGlob to change pattern matching behavior.  Also, some have been added,\nor have glob-specific ramifications.\n\nAll options are false by default, unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll options are added to the Glob object, as well.\n\nIf you are running many `glob` operations, you can pass a Glob object\nas the `options` argument to a subsequent operation to shortcut some\n`stat` and `readdir` calls.  At the very least, you may pass in shared\n`symlinks`, `statCache`, `realpathCache`, and `cache` options, so that\nparallel glob operations will be sped up by sharing information about\nthe filesystem.\n\n* `cwd` The current working directory in which to search.  Defaults\n  to `process.cwd()`.\n* `root` The place where patterns starting with `/` will be mounted\n  onto.  Defaults to `path.resolve(options.cwd, "/")` (`/` on Unix\n  systems, and `C:\\` or some such on Windows.)\n* `dot` Include `.dot` files in normal matches and `globstar` matches.\n  Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern will always\n  match dot files.\n* `nomount` By default, a pattern starting with a forward-slash will be\n  "mounted" onto the root setting, so that a valid filesystem path is\n  returned.  Set this flag to disable that behavior.\n* `mark` Add a `/` character to directory matches.  Note that this\n  requires additional stat calls.\n* `nosort` Don\'t sort the results.\n* `stat` Set to true to stat *all* results.  This reduces performance\n  somewhat, and is completely unnecessary, unless `readdir` is presumed\n  to be an untrustworthy indicator of file existence.\n* `silent` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to\n  read a directory, a warning will be printed to stderr.  Set the\n  `silent` option to true to suppress these warnings.\n* `strict` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to\n  read a directory, the process will just continue on in search of\n  other matches.  Set the `strict` option to raise an error in these\n  cases.\n* `cache` See `cache` property above.  Pass in a previously generated\n  cache object to save some fs calls.\n* `statCache` A cache of results of filesystem information, to prevent\n  unnecessary stat calls.  While it should not normally be necessary\n  to set this, you may pass the statCache from one glob() call to the\n  options object of another, if you know that the filesystem will not\n  change between calls.  (See "Race Conditions" below.)\n* `symlinks` A cache of known symbolic links.  You may pass in a\n  previously generated `symlinks` object to save `lstat` calls when\n  resolving `**` matches.\n* `sync` DEPRECATED: use `glob.sync(pattern, opts)` instead.\n* `nounique` In some cases, brace-expanded patterns can result in the\n  same file showing up multiple times in the result set.  By default,\n  this implementation prevents duplicates in the result set.  Set this\n  flag to disable that behavior.\n* `nonull` Set to never return an empty set, instead returning a set\n  containing the pattern itself.  This is the default in glob(3).\n* `debug` Set to enable debug logging in minimatch and glob.\n* `nobrace` Do not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.\n* `noglobstar` Do not match `**` against multiple filenames.  (Ie,\n  treat it as a normal `*` instead.)\n* `noext` Do not match `+(a|b)` "extglob" patterns.\n* `nocase` Perform a case-insensitive match.  Note: on\n  case-insensitive filesystems, non-magic patterns will match by\n  default, since `stat` and `readdir` will not raise errors.\n* `matchBase` Perform a basename-only match if the pattern does not\n  contain any slash characters.  That is, `*.js` would be treated as\n  equivalent to `**/*.js`, matching all js files in all directories.\n* `nonegate` Suppress `negate` behavior.  (See below.)\n* `nocomment` Suppress `comment` behavior.  (See below.)\n* `nonull` Return the pattern when no matches are found.\n* `nodir` Do not match directories, only files.  (Note: to match\n  *only* directories, simply put a `/` at the end of the pattern.)\n* `ignore` Add a pattern or an array of patterns to exclude matches.\n* `follow` Follow symlinked directories when expanding `**` patterns.\n  Note that this can result in a lot of duplicate references in the\n  presence of cyclic links.\n* `realpath` Set to true to call `fs.realpath` on all of the results.\n  In the case of a symlink that cannot be resolved, the full absolute\n  path to the matched entry is returned (though it will usually be a\n  broken symlink)\n\n## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations\n\nWhile strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile\ngoal, some discrepancies exist between node-glob and other\nimplementations, and are intentional.\n\nIf the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the\n`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`\ncharacters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the\npattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`\ncharacters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple\ntimes.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and\nwill not match anything.  Use `\\#` to match a literal `#` at the\nstart of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.\n\nThe double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the\n`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob\nand bash 4.3, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only\nthing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but\n`a/**b` will not.\n\nNote that symlinked directories are not crawled as part of a `**`,\nthough their contents may match against subsequent portions of the\npattern.  This prevents infinite loops and duplicates and the like.\n\nIf an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,\nthen glob returns the pattern as-provided, rather than\ninterpreting the character escapes.  For example,\n`glob.match([], "\\\\*a\\\\?")` will return `"\\\\*a\\\\?"` rather than\n`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except\nthat it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\n\nIf brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any\nother interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like\n`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded\n**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are\nchecked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.\n\n## Windows\n\n**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**\n\nThough windows uses either `/` or `\\` as its path separator, only `/`\ncharacters are used by this glob implementation.  You must use\nforward-slashes **only** in glob expressions.  Back-slashes will always\nbe interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.\n\nResults from absolute patterns such as `/foo/*` are mounted onto the\nroot setting using `path.join`.  On windows, this will by default result\nin `/foo/*` matching `C:\\foo\\bar.txt`.\n\n## Race Conditions\n\nGlob searching, by its very nature, is susceptible to race conditions,\nsince it relies on directory walking and such.\n\nAs a result, it is possible that a file that exists when glob looks for\nit may have been deleted or modified by the time it returns the result.\n\nAs part of its internal implementation, this program caches all stat\nand readdir calls that it makes, in order to cut down on system\noverhead.  However, this also makes it even more susceptible to races,\nespecially if the cache or statCache objects are reused between glob\ncalls.\n\nUsers are thus advised not to use a glob result as a guarantee of\nfilesystem state in the face of rapid changes.  For the vast majority\nof operations, this is never a problem.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny change to behavior (including bugfixes) must come with a test.\n\nPatches that fail tests or reduce performance will be rejected.\n\n```\n# to run tests\nnpm test\n\n# to re-generate test fixtures\nnpm run test-regen\n\n# to benchmark against bash/zsh\nnpm run bench\n\n# to profile javascript\nnpm run prof\n```\n',

If the predicate encounters an error, pass it to the completion\ncallback. Otherwise, pass the truthy value passed by the predicate, or\n`false` if no truthy value was passed.\n\nIs\n[Zalgo](http://blog.izs.me/post/59142742143/designing-apis-for-asynchrony)-proof,\nbrowser-safe, and pretty efficient.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar some = require("async-some");\nvar resolve = require("path").resolve;\nvar stat = require("fs").stat;\nvar readFileSync = require("fs").readFileSync;\n\nsome(["apple", "seaweed", "ham", "quince"], porkDetector, function (error, match) {\n  if (error) return console.error(error);\n\n  if (match) return console.dir(JSON.parse(readFileSync(match)));\n\n  console.error("time to buy more Sporkle™!");\n});\n\nvar PREFIX = resolve(__dirname, "../pork_store");\nfunction porkDetector(value, cb) {\n  var path = resolve(PREFIX, value + ".json");\n  stat(path, function (er, stat) {\n    if (er) {\n      if (er.code === "ENOENT") return cb(null, false);\n\n      return cb(er);\n    }\n\n    cb(er, path);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### some(list, test, callback)\n\n* `list` {Object} An arraylike (either an Array or the arguments arraylike) to\n  be checked.\n* `test` {Function} The predicate against which the elements of `list` will be\n  tested. Takes two parameters:\n  * `element` {any} The element of the list to be tested.\n  * `callback` {Function} The continuation to be called once the test is\n    complete. Takes (again) two values:\n    * `error` {Error} Any errors that the predicate encountered.\n    * `value` {any} A truthy value. A non-falsy result terminates checking the\n      entire list.\n* `callback` {Function} The callback to invoke when either a value has been\n  found or the entire input list has been processed with no result. Is invoked\n  with the traditional two parameters:\n  * `error` {Error} Errors that were encountered during the evaluation of some().\n  * `match` {any} Value successfully matched by `test`, if any.\n',

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`.

194164 silly resolved     readme: '# minimatch\n\nA minimal matching utility.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch.png)](http://travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n\nThis is the matching library used internally by npm.\n\nIt works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp`\nobjects.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar minimatch = require("minimatch")\n\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.foo") // true!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.bar") // false!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.+(bar|foo)", { debug: true }) // true, and noisy!\n```\n\n## Features\n\nSupports these glob features:\n\n* Brace Expansion\n* Extended glob matching\n* "Globstar" `**` matching\n\nSee:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash`\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n\n## Minimatch Class\n\nCreate a minimatch object by instanting the `minimatch.Minimatch` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Minimatch = require("minimatch").Minimatch\nvar mm = new Minimatch(pattern, options)\n```\n\n### Properties\n\n* `pattern` The original pattern the minimatch object represents.\n* `options` The options supplied to the constructor.\n* `set` A 2-dimensional array of regexp or string expressions.\n  Each row in the\n  array corresponds to a brace-expanded pattern.  Each item in the row\n  corresponds to a single path-part.  For example, the pattern\n  `{a,b/c}/d` would expand to a set of patterns like:\n\n        [ [ a, d ]\n        , [ b, c, d ] ]\n\n    If a portion of the pattern doesn\'t have any "magic" in it\n    (that is, it\'s something like `"foo"` rather than `fo*o?`), then it\n    will be left as a string rather than converted to a regular\n    expression.\n\n* `regexp` Created by the `makeRe` method.  A single regular expression\n  expressing the entire pattern.  This is useful in cases where you wish\n  to use the pattern somewhat like `fnmatch(3)` with `FNM_PATH` enabled.\n* `negate` True if the pattern is negated.\n* `comment` True if the pattern is a comment.\n* `empty` True if the pattern is `""`.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `makeRe` Generate the `regexp` member if necessary, and return it.\n  Will return `false` if the pattern is invalid.\n* `match(fname)` Return true if the filename matches the pattern, or\n  false otherwise.\n* `matchOne(fileArray, patternArray, partial)` Take a `/`-split\n  filename, and match it against a single row in the `regExpSet`.  This\n  method is mainly for internal use, but is exposed so that it can be\n  used by a glob-walker that needs to avoid excessive filesystem calls.\n\nAll other methods are internal, and will be called as necessary.\n\n## Functions\n\nThe top-level exported function has a `cache` property, which is an LRU\ncache set to store 100 items.  So, calling these methods repeatedly\nwith the same pattern and options will use the same Minimatch object,\nsaving the cost of parsing it multiple times.\n\n### minimatch(path, pattern, options)\n\nMain export.  Tests a path against the pattern using the options.\n\n```javascript\nvar isJS = minimatch(file, "*.js", { matchBase: true })\n```\n\n### minimatch.filter(pattern, options)\n\nReturns a function that tests its\nsupplied argument, suitable for use with `Array.filter`.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = fileList.filter(minimatch.filter("*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.match(list, pattern, options)\n\nMatch against the list of\nfiles, in the style of fnmatch or glob.  If nothing is matched, and\noptions.nonull is set, then return a list containing the pattern itself.\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = minimatch.match(fileList, "*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.makeRe(pattern, options)\n\nMake a regular expression object from the pattern.\n\n## Options\n\nAll options are `false` by default.\n\n### debug\n\nDump a ton of stuff to stderr.\n\n### nobrace\n\nDo not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.\n\n### noglobstar\n\nDisable `**` matching against multiple folder names.\n\n### dot\n\nAllow patterns to match filenames starting with a period, even if\nthe pattern does not explicitly have a period in that spot.\n\nNote that by default, `a/**/b` will **not** match `a/.d/b`, unless `dot`\nis set.\n\n### noext\n\nDisable "extglob" style patterns like `+(a|b)`.\n\n### nocase\n\nPerform a case-insensitive match.\n\n### nonull\n\nWhen a match is not found by `minimatch.match`, return a list containing\nthe pattern itself if this option is set.  When not set, an empty list\nis returned if there are no matches.\n\n### matchBase\n\nIf set, then patterns without slashes will be matched\nagainst the basename of the path if it contains slashes.  For example,\n`a?b` would match the path `/xyz/123/acb`, but not `/xyz/acb/123`.\n\n### nocomment\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating `#` at the start of a pattern as a\ncomment.\n\n### nonegate\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating a leading `!` character as negation.\n\n### flipNegate\n\nReturns from negate expressions the same as if they were not negated.\n(Ie, true on a hit, false on a miss.)\n\n\n## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations\n\nWhile strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile\ngoal, some discrepancies exist between minimatch and other\nimplementations, and are intentional.\n\nIf the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the\n`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`\ncharacters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the\npattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`\ncharacters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple\ntimes.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and\nwill not match anything.  Use `\\#` to match a literal `#` at the\nstart of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.\n\nThe double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the\n`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob\nand bash 4.1, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only\nthing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but\n`a/**b` will not.\n\nIf an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,\nthen minimatch.match returns the pattern as-provided, rather than\ninterpreting the character escapes.  For example,\n`minimatch.match([], "\\\\*a\\\\?")` will return `"\\\\*a\\\\?"` rather than\n`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except\nthat it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\n\nIf brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any\nother interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like\n`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded\n**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are\nchecked for validity.

Once the\nfunction is called for the first time the return value of the original\nfunction is saved in `fn.value` and subsequent calls will continue to\nreturn this value.\n\n```javascript\nvar once = require(\'once\')\n\nfunction load (cb) {\n  cb = once(cb)\n  var stream = createStream()\n  stream.once(\'data\', cb)\n  stream.once(\'end\', function () {\n    if (!cb.called) cb(new Error(\'not found\'))\n  })\n}\n```\n',

(default `process.stdin`)\n* `output` Writeable stream to write prompts to. (default: `process.stdout`)\n\nIf silent is true, and the input is a TTY, then read will set raw\nmode, and read character by character.\n\n## COMPATIBILITY\n\nThis module works sort of with node 0.6.  It does not work with node\nversions less than 0.6.  It is best on node 0.8.\n\nOn node version 0.6, it will remove all listeners on the input\nstream\'s `data` and `keypress` events, because the readline module did\nnot fully clean up after itself in that version of node, and did not\nmake it possible to clean up after it in a way that has no potential\nfor side effects.\n\nAdditionally, some of the readline options (like `terminal`) will not\nfunction in versions of node before 0.8, because they were not\nimplemented in the builtin readline module.\n\n## CONTRIBUTING\n\nPatches welcome.\n',

Once the\nfunction is called for the first time the return value of the original\nfunction is saved in `fn.value` and subsequent calls will continue to\nreturn this value.\n\n```javascript\nvar once = require(\'once\')\n\nfunction load (cb) {\n  cb = once(cb)\n  var stream = createStream()\n  stream.once(\'data\', cb)\n  stream.once(\'end\', function () {\n    if (!cb.called) cb(new Error(\'not found\'))\n  })\n}\n```\n',
