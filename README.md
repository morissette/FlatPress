# FlatPress
A blogging platform optimized for cost and performance

## Why
After years of working with Wordpress and watching my monthly EC2 costs growing from hosting a personal tech blog; I've decided there has to be a better way. Thats when I started this project to migrate my current Wordpress installation $200/month on EC2 with reserved instances to be a static AngularJS Application that can be served from S3 or Cloudfront in AWS

## Getting Started
1. Create an AWS Account
2. Create an S3 Bucket
3. Upload files to S3 Bucket
4. Point DNS
5. Publish Updates anywhere

## Todo
Everything... Literally just started...

1. Cross platform system to publish articles
2. Mobile App
3. Make themability easy
4. Determine plugin implementations (must be js only)
  a. bower?
  b. grunt or gulp?

## Features
Just planning right now; no code has been written so any features you see here have not been implemented

1. Themable
2. Extendable
3. Automated
4. Comments (Disqus?)
5. Sharing (ShareThis?)
6. Posting (Custom; Go binary for ease of distribution?)
